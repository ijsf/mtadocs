 
{{Server client function}}
<!--
{{Note box|Pre r4844: There are two types of world objects Binary IPL (anything not in data/maps and in gta3.img) and data IPL (anything in data/maps) Binary IPL removal requires a stream out if you are deleting anything within 300 units (anything visible) you can just move the camera to do this. Data IPL are removed instantly and this is not required. Also LOD objects are not removed automatically so you need to remove them separately.}}
-->
This function is used to remove a world object.
<!--
{{Tip|Pre r4844: It is strongly advised that you use this server side rather than client side because it will just function infinitely better as you should not need to handle streaming it out/back in.}}
