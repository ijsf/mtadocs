This function sets the players clipboard text (what appears when you paste with CTRL + V) Note that there is no getClipBoard function for safety reasons.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setClipboard ( string theText )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theText:''' The new text to be in the players clipboard when the player pastes with CTRL + V.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the text in the clip board was set correctly.

==Example== 
This example adds a command called clipboard which lets you set your clipboard text.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addCommandHandler( "clipboard", -- add a command handler for the command
   function( command, ... )
      local text = table.concat({...}, " ") -- if the text has spaces this will turn it into a string
      local success = setClipboard( text ) -- set the clipboard and find out if it worked
      if success then
         outputChatBox( "Clipboard text set to: " .. text, 0, 255, 0 ) -- if it did, tell the player
      else
         outputChatBox( "Failed to set the clipboards text", 255, 0, 0 ) -- if it didn't, tell the player
      end
   end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
