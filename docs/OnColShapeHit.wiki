This event is triggered when a physical [[/element.md|element]] hits a [[/colshape.md|colshape]].

'''NOTE''': The hit won't be detected if the [[/element.md|element]] that entered the colshape is a colshape.
==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element hitElement, bool matchingDimension
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''hitElement''': the [[/element.md|element]] that entered the colshape.
*'''matchingDimension''': a boolean referring to whether the hit collision shape was in the same dimension as the element.

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the [[/colshape.md|colshape]] that got hit by a player or vehicle.

==Example== 
This example creates a hill area for a ''King of the hill'' gamemode.  When a player enters or leaves the area, it's announced in the chatbox.

-- create our hill area for our gamemode

-- add hill_Enter as a handler for when a player enters the hill area
function hill_Enter ( thePlayer, matchingDimension )
        if getElementType ( thePlayer ) == "player" then --if the element that entered was player
