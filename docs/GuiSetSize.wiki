{{Client function}}

This function sets the dimensions (size) of a GUI element. It refers to the bounding box size for GUI elements. It does not make GUI elements smaller or larger in appearance.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool guiSetSize ( element gui, float width, float height, bool relative )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''guiElement:''' the GUI element whose visibility is to be changed
*'''width:''' The desired width setting for the gui element
*'''height:''' The desired height setting for the gui element
*'''relative:''' This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is ''true'', then all x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing sizes relative to the parent.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the gui element's size was set successfully, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This example creates a gui window and changes the x and y width of the window every 2 seconds.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">function changeWindowSize ( )
	--Called by the timer every 2 seconds. It decides an x and y width randomly between .1 and .5
	guiSetSize ( myWindow, ( math.random( 10, 50 ) / 100 ), ( math.random( 10, 50 ) / 100 ), true )
end

--Create a gui window called 'myWindow'
myWindow = guiCreateWindow ( 0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 0.60, "GUI window title", true )
--Set a timer to change the window's size every 2 seconds, infinite times
setTimer ( changeWindowSize, 2000, 0 )</syntaxhighlight>
