{{New feature/item|3.0130|1.3.0|4162|
This function checks whether panning is enabled in a [[/sound.md|sound]] [[/element.md|element]] or not.
}}
{{Tip|Althrough this function works in no-3D sounds (those created by [[/playSound.md|playSound]]), it only makes sense to use it with 3D sounds (created by [[/playSound3D.md|playSound3D]]). Please refer to [[/setSoundPanningEnabled.md|setSoundPanningEnabled]] for a explanation of what this property does.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool isSoundPanningEnabled ( element theSound )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{New feature/item|3.0141|1.4.0|6987|{{OOP||[[/sound.md|sound]]:isPanningEnabled|panningEnabled|setSoundPanningEnabled}}}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theSound :''' A valid [[/sound.md|sound]] [[/element.md|element]].

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the sound is valid and it has panning enabled, ''false'' if it does not or is not valid.

==Example==
This example plays a ''xy.mp3'' file in the root folder of the resource which contains it at the center of the map, and proves that by default a sound enables panning by outputting the result of this function to the chatbox right after creating it. Then it disables the panning of the sound.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local function testPanning()
    -- Create the sound and output the panning property state
    local sound = playSound3D("xy.mp3", 0, 0, 0)
    outputChatBox("By default, the sound has its panning " .. (isSoundPanningEnabled(sound) and "enabled" or "disabled"))
    -- Disable the panning and ouput a fact
    setSoundPanningEnabled(sound, false)
    outputChatBox("The sound panning was disabled, so it won't annoy you when the camera it's in a side anymore!", 0, 255, 0)
end
addEventHandler("onClientResourceStart", resourceRoot, testPanning)
