{{Deprecated feature|3|1.0|Serverside only in DP2.x}}
<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This function will allow you to determine if a player's name tag is currently showing.

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool isPlayerNametagShowing ( player thePlayer )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/player.md|player]]:isNametagShowing|nametagShowing|setPlayerNametagShowing}}
===Required Arguments=== 
<!-- List each argument one per line. This should be the argument's name as in the argument list above, NOT the argument's data type -->
*'''thePlayer:''' The player whose current name tag condition you want to check

===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns ''true'' if the player's name tag is being shown, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
<!-- Explain what the example is in a single sentance -->
This example toggles a player's nametag. If no playername is given, it toggles the nametag of the player who entered the command.
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function toggleNametag ( sourcePlayer, command, who )
	local tplayer = sourcePlayer                   -- by default, toggle the name tag of the player who issued the command
	if ( who ) then                                -- if there was a nick entered in the command
		tplayer = getPlayerFromName ( who )    -- search for the player
	else
		whoNick = getPlayerName(sourcePlayer)
	end
	if ( tplayer ~= false ) then                                -- if the player was found (or no playername was entered)
		if isPlayerNametagShowing ( tplayer ) then          -- if the nametag is shown
			setPlayerNametagShowing ( tplayer, false )  -- hide it
			outputChatBox ( who .. "'s nametag is now hidden", sourcePlayer )  -- output a message to the player who entered the command
		else                                                -- if the nametag is not shown
			setPlayerNametagShowing ( tplayer, true )   -- show it
			outputChatBox ( who .. "'s nametag is now showing", sourcePlayer ) -- output a message to the player who entered the command
		end
	else
		outputChatBox ( "Player not found.", sourcePlayer )
	end
