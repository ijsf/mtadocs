This page outlines some of the places Grand Theft Auto San Andreas can be bought digitally and played with MTASA (sometimes with an automatic downgrade step).  Not all of these have been tested, but all should work correctly.  If not, please contact support.  

All disc (DVD) versions of Windows GTASA are known to function fine.  If you are planning on buying a DVD of GTASA, you should try to obtain a "Standard" version rather than "Second Edition" or "Greatest Hits" editions, though all will work fine.
