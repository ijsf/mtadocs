{{Server client function}}
This function is used to get the element a [[/ped.md|ped]] is currently targeting.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element getPedTarget ( ped thePed )
</syntaxhighlight>

{{OOP||[[/ped.md|ped]]:getTarget}}
===Required Arguments===
*'''thePed:''' The [[/ped.md|ped]] whose target you want to retrieve.

===Returns===
Returns the [[/element.md|element]] that's being targeted, or ''false'' if there isn't one.

This is only effective on physical GTA elements, namely:
* Players
* Vehicles
* Objects

==Example==
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
This example blows up any vehicle a player targets (aims at).
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function playerTargetCheck ( )
    local target
    for i, thePlayer in ipairs ( getElementsByType("player") ) do  -- iterate over all players
        target = getPedTarget ( thePlayer )                        -- get the target of the current player
        if ( target ) then                                         -- if there was a target
            if ( getElementType ( target ) == "vehicle" ) then     -- and the target is a vehicle
                blowVehicle ( target )                             -- blow it up
            end
        end
    end
end
setTimer ( playerTargetCheck, 1000, 0 )                            -- call the check function every second

''Note: A more efficient way to do this would be to use the [[/onPlayerTarget.md|onPlayerTarget]] event.''
