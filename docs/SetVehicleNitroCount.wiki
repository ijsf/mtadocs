{{New feature/item|3.0131|1.3.1|4993|
This function sets how many times a player can activate the nitro on a specified [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]].
}}
{{Warning|Only works if the vehicle is streamed in.}}
==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool setVehicleNitroCount ( vehicle theVehicle, int count )</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theVehicle''': the [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] which you want to modify how many times a player can use its nitro.
*'''count''': how many times should the player be able to use the nitro of this [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] (from 0-100 times; 0 means that it can't be used and 101 means that it can be used infinite times).

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the nitro count was set successfully to the vehicle, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
<section name="Client" class="client" show="true">
This function installs nitro in the vehicle a player enters and then makes it usable only twice.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function infiniteNitro(pPlayer)
	if pPlayer == localPlayer then
		if not getVehicleUpgradeOnSlot(source, 8) then -- Does the vehicle have nitro installed or not
			addVehicleUpgrade(source, 1010) -- Install nitrous
		end
		setVehicleNitroCount(source, 2) -- Make the nitro usable twice
	end
end
addEventHandler("onClientVehicleEnter", root, infiniteNitro)
