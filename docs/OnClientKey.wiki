{{Client event}}
 
This event triggers whenever the user presses a button on their keyboard or mouse.
This event can also be used to see if the client scrolls his mousewheel.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">string button, bool pressOrRelease
</syntaxhighlight>
* '''button''':  This refers the button pressed. see [[/Key names.md|Key names]] for list of keys string
* '''pressOrRelease''': This refers to whether they were pressing or releasing the key, true when pressing, false when releasing.

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the client's [[/root element.md|root element]].

==Cancel effect==
{{New items|5620|1.4|
If this event is [[/Event_system#Canceling.md|canceled]], then all GTA and MTA binds, bound to the canceled key, won't be triggered.
'''Note:''' the escape key can only be cancelled once. If a user presses the escape key twice in a row the main menu will still open.
}}

==Example== 
This example will say in chatbox every time the user presses down a a key.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function playerPressedKey(button, press)
    if (press) then -- Only output when they press it down
        outputChatBox("You pressed the "..button.." key!")
    end
end
addEventHandler("onClientKey", root, playerPressedKey)
</syntaxhighlight>

This example outputs if the client moves his mousewheel.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onClientKey", root, function(button,press) 
    -- Since mouse_wheel_up and mouse_wheel_down cant return a release, we dont have to check the press.
    if button == "mouse_wheel_up" or button == "mouse_wheel_down" then
        outputDebugString( button .. " moved." )
        return true
    end
    return false
end )
</syntaxhighlight>
