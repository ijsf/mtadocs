Weather can be changed using [[/setWeather.md|setWeather]] and [[/setWeatherBlended.md|setWeatherBlended]] functions. In GTA: SA, every weather has different parameters for the sunrise, morning, midday, noon, afternoon, sunset, night and midnight, so a weather can vary a lot deppending of the time of the day.

{{New feature|3|1.0|
Non-standard weather ID's between 20 and 255 are also supported, but they might be buggy at some moments of the day.
}}

MTA: SA has custom weather functions which can modify how a weather is rendered, but in this list the weathers are described without taking that into account. Also, using [[/setWeatherBlended.md|setWeatherBlended]] allows for more undocumented effects.

If you want to see some screenshots of the first 45 weather IDs during different times of the day, visit [http://hotmist.ddo.jp/id/weather.html this page] for now.
