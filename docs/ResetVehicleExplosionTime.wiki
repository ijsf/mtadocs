{{Server function}}

Resets the vehicle explosion time. This is the point in time at which the vehicle last exploded: at this time plus the vehicle's respawn delay, the vehicle is respawned. You can use this function to prevent the vehicle from respawning.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool resetVehicleExplosionTime ( vehicle theVehicle )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theVehicle:''' The vehicle you wish to reset the explosion time from.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the vehicle explosion time has been reset, ''false'' if it failed to reset the explosion time.

==Example==
This example resets every vehicle's explosion time when the resource is stopped.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function resetVehiclesExplosionTime ()
	local vehicles = getElementsByType ( "vehicle" ) -- Return all the vehicles in a table
		for k, vehicle in ipairs ( vehicles ) do -- For every vehicle do the following...
			resetVehicleExplosionTime ( vehicle ) -- Reset the vehicle's explosion time
		end
end
-- When this resource is stopped, trigger the resetVehiclesExplosionTime function (above).
