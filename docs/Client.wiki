The client class represents any client that is connected to the server. Therefore, clients are created and destroyed automatically by players' connections or disconnections. They usually are the MTA: SA copy that a [[/player.md|player]] is using (so it has more information about the world), but it can also be the [[/Element/Console.md|server console]].

All client-managing functions operate on both player and server console elements, so the element responsible for a kick can be the server console, for example. However, the server console is protected against some of that functions: it can't get kicked or banned.

The players' clients are also responsible of informing the server about the state of the elements that they're [[/SetElementSyncer.md|syncing]], so they're essential for accurate sync of peds and vehicles. They also receive data from other clients and the server.
