Spawnmanager is a resource that provides some default spawning functions.  It provides ideal conditions for gamemodes which require fairly basic spawning systems, and uses the <spawnpoint/> element for all its functions.  

Spawnmanager also offers basic support for a ''waves'' spawning system - which involves spawning multiple players at regular periods of time.  Spawnmanager does not internally support delayed spawning, though [[/setTimer.md|setTimer]] can be used in conjunction with [[/Resource:Spawnmanager/spawnPlayerAtSpawnpoint.md|spawnPlayerAtSpawnpoint]] to achieve this.
