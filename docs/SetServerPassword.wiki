<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This function changes the password required to join the server to the given string.

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setServerPassword ( string thePassword )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
<!-- List each argument one per line. This should be the argument's name as in the argument list above, NOT the argument's data type -->
*'''thePassword:''' The new server password you want. Pass ''nil'' or an empty string to remove the password.

===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns ''true'' if the password was successfully changed or removed, ''false'' or ''nil'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This example adds two commands for you to use: setpassword and removepassword.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addCommandHandler( "setpassword", -- add a command handler for the command
   function( thePlayer, command, password )
      if #password < 3 then -- check if the password is shorter than 3 letters
         outputChatBox( "The password needs to be atleast 3 letters long!", thePlayer ) -- tell the player that password was too short
         return -- abort command
      end
      local success = setServerPassword( password ) -- check whether changing password worked
      if success then
         outputChatBox( "Server password change to: " .. password, thePlayer ) -- if it did, tell the player
      else
         outputChatBox( "Failed to change servers password.", thePlayer ) -- if it didn't, tell the player
      end
   end
)

addCommandHandler( "removepassword", -- add a command handler for the command
   function( thePlayer, command )
      local success = setServerPassword( nil ) -- check whether removing password worked
      if success then
         outputChatBox( "Server password removed successfully", thePlayer ) -- if it did, tell the player
      else
         outputChatBox( "Failed to remove servers password.", thePlayer ) -- if it didn't, tell the player
      end
   end
)
