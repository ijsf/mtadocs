{{Server client function}} 
 
This function can disable or enable an element's collisions. An element without collisions does not interact with the physical environment and remains static.

{{Note|Vehicles that are collisionless and have a driver will cause bugs.}}
{{Note|Enabling a players collisions when they're inside a vehicle will cause bugs.}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setElementCollisionsEnabled ( element theElement, bool enabled ) 
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/element.md|element]]:setCollisionsEnabled||}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theElement:''' The element you wish to set the collisions of
*'''enabled:''' A boolean to indicate whether collisions are enabled (''true'') or disabled (''false'')

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the collisions were set succesfully, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This example disables collisions for all vehicles within a certain radius of a player:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function disableVehicleCollisionsNearPlayer(thePlayer, maxDistance)
	local playerX, playerY, playerZ = getElementPosition(thePlayer)
	local vehicles = getElementsByType("vehicle")
	for k,v in ipairs(vehicles) do
		local vehicleX, vehicleY, vehicleZ = getElementPosition(v)
		-- get the distance between the player and the vehicle:
		local distance = getDistanceBetweenPoints3D(vehicleX, vehicleY, vehicleZ, playerX, playerY, playerZ)
		if (distance <= maxDistance) then
			-- disable collisions for the vehicle
			setElementCollisionsEnabled(v, false)
		end
	end
end
</syntaxhighlight>
