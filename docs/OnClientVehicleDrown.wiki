This event is triggered when a vehicle starts to drown in water. This event is even triggered when vehicles merely come into contact with water, so not every trigger is an indication of actual drowning.

==Parameters==
This event has no parameters.

==Source==
The source of this event is the [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] that is drowning.

==Example==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">addEventHandler("onClientVehicleDrown",root,function()
     outputChatBox("* A "..getVehicleName(source).." is drowning!")
end)</syntaxhighlight>
