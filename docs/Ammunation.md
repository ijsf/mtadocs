Ammunations are functioning on all three islands on GTA3:MTA. You can purchase weapons, armor, health on all islands, and a taxi (for gamemode selection) on the [Shoreside Vale](/docs/GTA3_SSV.md "wikilink") island. Ammunations can be found by holding down right-click while outside a vehicle, which will result in blips to appear on the radar. The only selectable weapons are:

An Uzi is selected by default in the character selction menu. This is a good all-around weapon.

The Flamethrower is a popular choice, although flamethrowing players are often unpopular with other players. This is more suited to close-range combat. Some will even ban people who use the flamethrower to kill.

The AK-47 is suitable for long-range combat.

The most common choice is the Shotgun. Shotgun duels are frequent, and take advantage of “shotgun jumping.” This is when you shoot the opponent, jump over to the opponent, then shoot him while he's on the ground. This normally results in an instant kill.
