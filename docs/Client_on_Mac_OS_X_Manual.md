Before you start
----------------

First of all, please ensure your computer fits the requirements needed. Read the [Client Manual](/docs/Client_Manual.md "wikilink") page for further informations, or join us on IRC @ <irc://irc.multitheftauto.com/mta>

### Requirements

The hardware requirements for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas are the same than on Windows. For software requirements, you need:

-   Wine (get it on your package manager (synaptic, apt, pacman, yum etc.); click [here](http://tinyurl.com/installWine1-3) if you're using Ubuntu
-   Windows fonts installed:
    -   tahoma.ttf
    -   tahomabd.ttf
    -   verdana.ttf

Get them on the Internet, e.g. [fontonic.com](http://fontonic.com/)

Or get the zip archive with the 3 fonts here: [wine\_mta\_fonts.zip](http://www.4shared.com/zip/IsErUbQAba/wine_mta_fonts.html)

Install them in:

    ~/.wine/dosdevices/c:/windows/Fonts/

(~/ points to your user home folder on Linux)

Installing the game
-------------------

Download the MTA installer from [mtasa.com](http://www.mtasa.com), ensure you can launch it (chmod +x) then install it when you want.

Running the game
----------------

Once installed, double-clicking on the Multi Theft Auto.exe should work. If not, try in a terminal the following command: “wine Multi Theft Auto.exe” in the directory you installed Multi Theft Auto to. If it doesn't work, check the contents of the file c:/Program\_Files/Multi Theft Auto/MTA/CEGUI.log, which may contain useful information.
