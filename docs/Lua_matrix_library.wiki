The Lua matrix library is a collection of stuff to help with matrix math. The original Lua source for that is here: [https://github.com/davidm/lua-matrix Lua matrix library on github]

However, we recommend you use the following files as they have been changed slightly to work better with MTA:
:*[http://mtasa-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/%5Beditor%5D/editor_main/client/matrix.lua matrix.lua]
:*[http://mtasa-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/%5Beditor%5D/editor_main/client/complex.lua complex.lua]
