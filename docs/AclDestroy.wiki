 
{{Server function}}
<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This function destroys the ACL passed. The destroyed ACL will no longer be valid.

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool aclDestroy ( acl theACL )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/acl.md|acl]]:destroy||}}
===Required Arguments=== 
<!-- List each argument one per line. This should be the argument's name as in the argument list above, NOT the argument's data type -->
*'''theACL:''' The ACL to destroy

===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns ''true'' if successfully destroyed and ''false'' if it could not be deleted (ie. it's not valid).

==Example== 
<!-- Explain what the example is in a single sentance -->
This example shows you a command to delete an ACL:
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function deleteSomeACL ( thePlayer, cmdname, theACL )
    if aclGet ( theACL ) then --Check if the specified ACL exists
        --If it does
        local deleted = aclDestroy ( theACL ) --Try to delete the ACL
        if deleted then --If the ACL has been deleted
            --We will give the player a succes-message
            outputChatBox ( "ACL " ..theACL.. " Succesfully removed!", thePlayer )
        else --If there was something wrong while deleting
            --We send the player an error message
            outputChatBox ( "Error while removing ACL " ..theACL.. "!", thePlayer )
        end
    else --If the ACL doesn't exists
        outputChatBox ( "Error: Invalid ACL Name specified, or the ACL doesn't exist.", thePlayer )
    end
end
addCommandHandler ( "deleteACL", deleteSomeACL ) --Add the commandhandler
