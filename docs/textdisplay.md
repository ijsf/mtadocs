A **textdisplay** object refers to a “canvas” that can contain many items of text ([textitems](/docs/textitem.md "wikilink")).

Each display can be seen by multiple observers ([players](/docs/player.md "wikilink")) and each observer can see multiple displays. For example, you could have a display that showed a score, and a display that showed information specific to one team, such as the location of a flag. Every player would be an observer of the first display and each team would have their own display that its players would be observers of.
