function outputIsInVehicle ( sourcePlayer, commandName, checkedPlayerName )
	-- we get the player element from the nick specified
	local checkedPlayer = getPlayerFromNick ( checkedPlayerName )
	-- if it exists,
	if ( checkedPlayer ) then
		-- if it's in a vehicle,
		if isPlayerInVehicle ( checkedPlayer ) then
			-- tell the source player
			outputChatBox ( checkedPlayerName .. " is in a vehicle.", sourcePlayer )
		-- if it's not in a vehicle,
		else
