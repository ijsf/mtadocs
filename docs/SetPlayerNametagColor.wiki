{{Server client function}}
<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This allows you to change the RGB color mixture in the name tags of players.
{{Note|If the player is using a hexcode in front of their name, it will override this function. You must first strip the name of the hexcode using [[/removeHex.md|removeHex]]}}

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setPlayerNametagColor ( player thePlayer, int r, int g, int b )
</syntaxhighlight> 

{{New feature|2|DP2|
'''OR'''

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">

This will allow a player to change the RGB color mixture of their nickname. Valid RGB is between 0-255.
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- The handler function for the console command
function nametagColorChange ( thePlayer, commandName, r, g, b )
    -- Apply the new color mix of RGB to the command handler activator
    setPlayerNametagColor ( thePlayer, r, g, b )
end
-- This is a command handler that activates on text "nametagcolor" in the console. It also asks 
-- the player to provide values for the extra parameters r, g, b after the command name. These will 
-- be the new color mix of RGB to apply to the player's name tag.
