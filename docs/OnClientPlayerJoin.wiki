{{Client event}}
This event is triggered when a [[/player.md|player]] joins a server. It is triggered for all players except the local player, as the local player joins the server before their client-side resources are started. It would also be possible for two players to join within a few seconds of each other and for the two players' scripts may not receive onClientPlayerJoin events as their scripts wouldn't have started yet.

==Parameters==
''None''

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the [[/player.md|player]] that joined the server.

==Example==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function remotePlayerJoin()
	outputChatBox("* " .. getPlayerName(source) .. " has joined the server")
end
addEventHandler("onClientPlayerJoin", getRootElement(), remotePlayerJoin)
</syntaxhighlight>
