An **int**eger is any whole number (i.e. without a decimal point). It can be positive, zero, or negative.

A number with a decimal point and following numbers is referred to as a [float](/docs/float.md "wikilink") number.

Lua allows you to use these interchangeably and will convert between the two as needed. [Category:Scripting Concepts](/docs/Category:Scripting_Concepts.md "wikilink")
