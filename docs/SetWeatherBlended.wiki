 
{{Server client function}}
This function will change the current [[/weather.md|weather]] to another in a smooth manner, over the period of 2 in-game hours (unlike [[/setWeather.md|setWeather]], which sets a new weather instantly). To ensure this transition performs as expected, you should not call this function until [[/getWeather.md|getWeather]] indicates that no transition is already being done.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setWeatherBlended ( int weatherID )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''weatherID:''' The ID of the [[/weather.md|weather]] state you wish to set. Valid values are 0 to 255 inclusive.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if successful, ''false'' if an invalid ''weatherID'' is passed.

==Example== 
This example sets the weather to sunny, then makes it change to a foggy over the period of two minutes (assuming that a in-game minute is a second in real time).
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- Set the weather to sunny
setWeather ( 0 )
-- Blend the weather to foggy
setWeatherBlended ( 9 )
</syntaxhighlight>
