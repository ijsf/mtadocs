{{Server client function}}
{{Deprecated|getElementRotation|}}

This function gets the rotation of a vehicle along the X, Y, and Z axes in degrees.

''Note: rotation Z returns value in CCW (counter-clock wise). So 3 o'clock is not 90 degrees, it's actually 270 degrees and 9 o'clock is not 270 degrees, it's 90 degrees. '''To fix this use: rotZ = (360-rotZ)'''''

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">float float float getVehicleRotation ( vehicle theVehicle )</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''theVehicle''': The [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] whose rotation you want to retrieve.

===Returns===
Returns three ''floats'' indicating the X, Y, and Z rotations of the vehicle in degrees, or ''false'' if the specified vehicle does not exist.

==Example==
This example creates a vehicle and gets its rotation:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">local newHydra = createVehicle ( 520, 1024, 1024, 1024 ) -- create a Hydra
local rx, ry, rz = getVehicleRotation ( newHydra ) -- get the vehicle's x, y and z rotations and store them in rx, ry, and rz
outputChatBox ( "Current rotation: " .. rx .. " " .. ry .. " " .. rz ) -- output the rotations
</syntaxhighlight>
