{{Deprecated|setPedStat|}}

This function allows you to set the float value of a specific statistic for a [[/player.md|player]]. '''Visual stats (FAT and BODY_MUSCLE) can only be used on the CJ skin.''' A large number of the stats will have no effect.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool setPlayerStat ( player thePlayer, int stat, float value )</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''thePlayer''': the [[/player.md|player]] whose statistic you want to modify.
*'''stat''': A whole number determining the stat ID. 
{{Stats}}

*'''value''': A float number the stat will be set to. (0..999)

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the statistic was changed succesfully. Returns ''false'' if an invalid player is specified, if the stat-id/value is out of acceptable range or if the FAT or BODY_MUSCLE stats are used on non-CJ players.

==Example==
This example allows a player to type the command 'beefcake' to change his player's BODY_MUSCLE stat (#23) to the maximum value of 999. This will result in him looking really muscular.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">function changeBodyStrength ( player, commandName )
    --Output whether the setPlayerStat was successful in changing the BODY_MUSCLE STAT     
    if ( setPlayerStat ( player, 23, 999 ) ) then
    	outputChatBox ( "Your player looks really muscular" )
    else
        outputChatBox ( "Failed to make your player look muscular." )
    end
end
addCommandHandler ( "beefcake", changeBodyStrength )</syntaxhighlight>
