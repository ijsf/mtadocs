{{Server client function}}
This function is used to create a new dummy element in the [[/element tree.md|element tree]] which do not necessarily represent an entity within the San Andreas world. A common use for this function is for creating custom elements, such as a Flag or a Base.

Elements created using this function are placed in the element tree with their parent as the 'dynamic' map element.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element createElement ( string elementType, [ string elementID = nil ] )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[/Element.md|Element]]}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''elementType:''' The type of element being created.

===Optional Arguments===
*'''elementID:''' The ID of the element being created.

===Returns===
Returns the element if it was successfully created. Returns ''false'' if the arguments are wrong.

==Example==
This example creates a "flag" element, named "blue", which will be at the resource's dynamic map.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
blueTeamFlag = createElement( "flag", "blue" )
</syntaxhighlight>

Except for it being placed in a different map root, that line will have the same effect as having this in a .map file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<flag id="blue" />
</syntaxhighlight>
