===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theAccount:''' The [[/account.md|account]] you wish to get the [[/player.md|player]] of.

===Returns===
Returns a [[/player.md|player]] element if the account is currently in use, ''false'' otherwise.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function isAccountUserAlive ( theAccount )
    local thePlayer = getAccountPlayer ( theAccount )       -- get the client attached to the account
    if ( getElementType ( thePlayer ) == "player" ) then    -- see if it really is a player (rather than a console admin for example)
        return not isPedDead(thePlayer)             -- if the player's health is greater than 0 
    end
    return false
end
