=== Features ===
* Huge increase in stability. Using the errors reported to us using the Error Report Tool, we've managed to fix a large number of the common crashes.
* New Staunton Island map available for GTA3, which includes a race mode and deathmatch.
* New Shoreside Vale map available for GTA3, which includes several gamemodes. 
* Lots of changes to the existing maps.
* A server browser has been added to the client along with an area to store your favourites and a list of servers you've played on recently (History). 
* New Client design - The client has been redesigned to make it easier to use. Error messages are now more self explanatory and checks are added to help users ensure their game is set up correctly. 
* Added an in-client server that allows you to quickly configure and host a server straight from the MTA Client.
* Integrated the MTA Protocol handler - now mta:// links will work for all MTA 0.5 users.
* Redesigned MTA Admin Tool to make it easier and more logical to use. 
* In client global MOTD so that you can hear about news from MTA immediately.
* A rich text welcome message that the server can show to players when they join. This can contain much more information than the normal Message of the Day and is visible in the client the entire time the user is on the server.
* New installation and configuration scripts for easy setup for Linux dedicated servers. 
* More platforms supported for the dedicated server, including FreeBSD and OpenBSD. 
* Improved error report tool is now installed by default (though optionally).
* Chat box in the client now scrolls properly, as most chat programs do (scroll up to stop auto-scroll). 

=== Minor Updates ===

* '''Patch 1''': A server [http://forum.multitheftauto.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=13923#p198981 patch] was released; the Message of The Day feature could be exploited.
* '''0.5.1 (2005)''': In February 2005 MTA 0.5.1 [http://files.mtasa.com/web/mta_0.5_launch/051.htm preview] was shown to the public, addressing known issues and adding new features. 0.5.1 was never released.
* '''0.5r2''': Members of the MTA community released a minor update called 0.5r2 for 0.5, this also includes a new (external) server browser, the included server browser in 0.5 client is non-functional since 2008.
** [http://forum.mtasa.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=31692#p336938 Download]
** [http://forum.mtasa.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=31692#p336939 Changelog for 0.5r2]
* '''0.5.1 (2013)''': In 2013 members of the MTA community called ''Project Redivivus'' are developing a minor update for 0.5 with major changes. This is likely to become open source.

MTA:SA Race is the first release that was made with the blue framework, a new approach to control the game (GTA). The sync was also better over the previous releases and the client is in game not an external application. Notice the blue GUI in the screenshot.

A new slogan was introduced: "Stop Playing With Yourself."
[[/File:Mtavcbluelaunching.png.md|MTA Loading screen with the new slogan: "Stop Playing With Yourself."|thumb|230px]]

=== Gamemodes ===
As the name suggests it is only race (you cannot get out of your vehicle).

=== Features ===
[[/File:MTASA-Race-Racing.jpg.md|Racing in MTA:SA|right|thumb|230px]]
* In game client.
* Map Editor to create a map in game.
* Optimised netcode results in reduced lag.
* Blue loads a DLL with the game instead of injecting code into its memory process. This improves stability and means that custom SCM files do not have to be moved to the game's directory when it is started. 
* Full integration means that Blue's server list is directly integrated into GTA's GUI.
* Fewer glitches. This is achieved by synchronizing every animation, implementing a custom pause menu so that people can't pause to escape death, and forcing the frame limiter on so that everyone's game runs at the same maximum speed. 
* Greater synchronization, this means that MTA players can finally use boats.
* Anti cheat. 

=== Minor Updates ===
* '''1.1'''
** New mappack
** New map nomination voting system
** Respawning during map
** Map timelimit added in map files and server config
** New player animation sync
** Admins can PM players from remote admin
** The 255 map limit has been fixed
** Fixed various admin stability issues
* '''1.1.1'''
** Fixed: Freezes that occurred frequently for some users (and not at all for others)
** Fixed: Nothing would happen after the splash screen appeared for some users
** Fixed: All players getting kicked from a server with a "protocol error 92" message
** Fixed: Players getting stuck in "You will respawn in 1 second" mode, if a race starts before they join completely
** Fixed: Issue where error reporter would sometimes fail to find core dump
** Fixed: Occasional crash when connecting to a server through the server browser
** Fixes: Various other crashes
** Added: An error message is now displayed if you try to use the ′order checkpoints′ option in the map editor if you have no checkpoints in your map
** Added: DefaultMapDuration and DefaultRespawnTime to server config
* '''1.1.2'''
** All-Seeing Eye server-browser has been removed in favour of a more reliable and faster replacement
** Removed redundant "MTA Center" references
** Removed support for built-in error reporter

No more releases for MTA:SA Race, the new MTA release made the race version obsolete, a new resource called 'race' which could read the race maps replaced it.

MTA:San Andreas Deathmatch Developer Preview 1 was the first release that featured on-foot synchronization for San Andreas. The name deathmatch refers to the ability to shoot with weapons and get on-foot unlike the race version. The tag deathmatch has been dropped in later releases because this version allowed customized gamemodes with LUA scripting and confused players. While the first 5 releases were called 'Developer Preview' it was very popular. In August 21, 2009 version 1.0.x was released with the GPLv3 license this allowed to work with more people on the next release when it became open source.

=== Gamemodes ===
This was the first released that allowed to create customized gamemodes with the LUA scripting language. No static gamemodes. 
Scripted gamemodes and utilities packed together are called resources.

=== Features ===
* On-foot synchronization.
* Improved vehicle synchronization.
* LUA scripting.
* New map editor with EDF (Editor Definition File) allowed to edit custom gamemodes created with LUA.
* Included web server in server side for remote administration or statistics.
* Client side scripting with LUA, allowing to transfer files to the client which can be used to create GUI on the client for example.
