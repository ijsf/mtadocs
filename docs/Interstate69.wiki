You should use the settings or info system for storing the settings. Don't use the map format :) [[/User:EAi.md|eAi]] 20:14, 5 November 2007 (CST)
Why is it called '''thearea''' rather than '''gamearea''' ? [[/User:EAi.md|eAi]] 20:15, 5 November 2007 (CST)
--------------------------------------
Im still waiting for proper documentation before i even try to convert it to the settings system.
thearea is changed to gamearea now :) [[/User:Lucif3r.md|Lucif3r]] 03:31, 6 November 2006 (GMT+1)

What documentation are you missing? [[/User:EAi.md|eAi]] 07:33, 6 November 2007 (CST)
* The meta.xml side of the settings system remains completely undocumented [[/User:Talidan2.md|Talidan2]] 09:12, 6 November 2007 (CST)

Is there any way you can use the standard 'vehicle' tag rather than tehVehicle? Would look better :) [[/User:EAi.md|eAi]] 06:16, 15 November 2007 (CST)

Not as long as <vehicle /> tags autocreates when the map starts. I think its fine as it is atm tbh, but I might change it in the future tho.  --[[/User:Lucif3r.md|Lucif3r]] 01:24, 28 November 2007 (CST)
