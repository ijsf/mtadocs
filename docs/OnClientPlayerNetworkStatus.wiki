}}
==Parameters== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int status, int ticks
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''status''': A number which is 0 if the interruption has begun, or 1 if the interruption is ending.
*'''ticks''': Number of ticks since the interruption started.

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the [[/root element.md|root element]].

==Example== 
This example shows a debug message when interruption starts and stops and also prevents the local player moving during the interruption.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
frozen = false -- This variable stores whether or not the script is going to freeze them.
-- If they were already frozen then don't unfreeze them when the interruption ends to avoid conflicts with other scripts.
function handleInterrupt( status, ticks )
	if (status == 0) then
		outputDebugString( "(packets from server) interruption began " .. ticks .. " ticks ago" )
		if (not isElementFrozen(localPlayer)) then
			setElementFrozen(localPlayer, true) -- Freeze them to prevent them abusing the network interruption
			frozen = true
		end
	elseif (status == 1) then
		outputDebugString( "(packets from server) interruption began " .. ticks .. " ticks ago and has just ended" )
		if (frozen) then
			setElementFrozen(localPlayer, false) -- If we froze them, unfreeze them now.
			frozen = false
		end
	end
end
addEventHandler( "onClientPlayerNetworkStatus", root, handleInterrupt)
