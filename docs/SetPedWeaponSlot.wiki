<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
This example allows the player to type the command 'giveweapons', which gives the player a weapon for every slot. Instead of equipping the last given weapon, the script randomly decides which weapon to equip after all the weapons are given.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">function givePlayerWeapons ( thePlayer, commandName )
        -- Give the player a weapon for each slot
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 1, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 2, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 22, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 25, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 28, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 30, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 33, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 35, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 16, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 42, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 10, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 44, 1 )
	giveWeapon ( thePlayer, 40, 1 )
        -- Randomly select which weapon to equip, slots 1 through 12
	setPedWeaponSlot ( thePlayer, math.random ( 1, 12) )
