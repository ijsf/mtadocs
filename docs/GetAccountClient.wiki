{{Server function}}
{{Deprecated|getAccountPlayer|}}

This function returns the client that is currently using a specified account, i.e. is logged into it. Only one client can use an account at a time.
==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
client getAccountClient ( account theAccount )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theAccount:''' The account you wish to get the client of.

===Returns===
Returns a [[/client.md|client]] element if the account is currently in use, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This example checks if the user attached to an account is a player, and if so if they're alive.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function isAccountUserAlive ( theAccount )
    local theClient = getAccountClient ( theAccount )       -- get the client attached to the account
    if ( getElementType ( theClient ) == "player" ) then    -- see if it's a player (rather than an admin for example)
        if ( not isPlayerDead ( theClient ) ) then          -- if the player's health is greater than 0 
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
