JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

MTA uses JSON in a number of places, most significantly it is used for communication over HTTP. See [[/Resource Web Access.md|Resource Web Access]]. You can encode JSON strings in the server using [[/toJSON.md|toJSON]] and decode them using [[/fromJSON.md|fromJSON]].

For more general information about JSON, see http://www.json.org.
