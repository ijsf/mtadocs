{{Server function}}
This function renames a resource.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool renameResource ( string resourceName, string newResourceName, [ string organizationalPath ] )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/resource.md|resource]]:rename}}
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''resourceName:''' The name of resource to rename.
*'''newResourceName:''' The name of what the resource should be renamed to.

===Optional Arguments===
*'''organizationalPath:''' If you want to store the new resource inside a category.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the resource has been renamed successfully, ''false'' otherwise. This could fail if the resource name already is in use, if a directory already exists with the name you've specified (but this isn't a valid resource) or if the name you specify isn't valid. It could also fail if the disk was full or for other similar reasons. Won't work on a started resource or if the resource is not loaded (not known by MTA (use /refresh))

==Example==
This example renames the resource "reload" to "reload2":
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">function renameReloadResource()
	renameResource("reload", "reload2");
end
addEventHandler("onResourceStart", resourceRoot, renameReloadResource);
</syntaxhighlight>
