An '''element''' is a generic class that can represent almost all in-game [[/entity.md|entities]]. The built-in element types are:

{{Elements}}

Any other element type can be created as an abstract element, not referring to any game [[/entity.md|entity]]. For example, '''resource''' and '''map''' elements are created when resources and maps are loaded to group entities they create as their children.

Elements share common functions such as type and list retrieval, a destroy operation to remove both the element and the game entity it is linked to (except for some elements which can't be destroyed, for example client elements), [[/element data.md|element data]] storing and retrieval, and many more common operations.

All elements are stored internally in a [[/Element_tree.md|tree structure]], and as such every element except the '''root''' element has a parent element, that can be the '''root''' element, a '''resource''', '''map''' or another element. This is purely for declaring the scope of function calls.
