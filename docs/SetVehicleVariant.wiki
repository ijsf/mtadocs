{{Server function}}

This function sets the variant of a specified vehicle. In GTA SA some vehicles are different for example the labelling on trucks or the contents of a pick-up truck and the varying types of a motor bike. For the default GTA SA variant list see: [[/Vehicle variants.md|Vehicle variants]]
 {{Tip|Both variant arguments need to be supplied, otherwise random ones will be picked.}} 
 {{Tip|If you only want one variant, set ''''variant2'''' to ''255''. If you want no variants, then set both ''''variant1'''' and ''''variant2'''' to ''255''}} 
 {{Note|The fairings on the NRG-500 and BF-400 are both variants, so unless you explicitly ask for 3 or 4, your bike will have no fairings which some people may find offensive.

{{OOP||[[/vehicle.md|vehicle]]:setVariant||getVehicleVariant}}
==Required Arguments==
*'''theVehicle:''' A handle to the [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] that you want to get the variant of.

==Optional Arguments==
Both arguments need to be supplied, otherwise random variants will be picked.
* '''variant1''': An integer for the first variant see [[/Vehicle variants.md|Vehicle variants]]
* '''variant2''': An integer for the second variant see [[/Vehicle variants.md|Vehicle variants]]

==Returns==
On success:
* '''bool''': Returns true as the vehicle variants were successfully set.
On failure:
* '''bool''': False because the specified vehicle didn't exist or specified variants were invalid.

==Example==
This example lets the vehicle driver set their vehicle variant with setvehvar
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function setMyVehiclesVariant(theUser, command, var1, var2)
    local var1, var2 = tonumber(var1), tonumber(var2) -- If anything was passed make sure its number or nil
    local myVeh = getPedOccupiedVehicle(theUser) -- Get the vehicle that they're in
    if (myVeh and getVehicleController(myVeh) == theUser) then -- Make sure they're in control
        local wasSet = setVehicleVariant(myVeh, var1, var2) -- Set what they wanted
        if (wasSet) then
            outputChatBox("Vehicle variant successfully set!", theUser, 0, 255, 0)
        else
            outputChatBox("Vehicle variant unsuccessfully set.", theUser, 255, 255, 0)
        end
    end
end
addCommandHandler("setvehvar", setMyVehiclesVariant) -- Add the command
