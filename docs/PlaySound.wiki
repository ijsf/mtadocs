 
{{Client function}}
Creates a [[/sound.md|sound]] [[/element.md|element]] and plays it immediately after creation for the local player.<br />
<br />
'''Note:''' The only supported audio formats are MP3, WAV, OGG, RIFF, MOD, XM, IT, S3M and PLS(e.g. Webstream).
{{Note|For performance reasons, when using playSound for effects that will be played lots (i.e. weapon fire), it is recommend that you convert your audio file to a one channel (mono) WAV with sample rate of 22050 Hz or less. Also consider adding a limit on how often the effect can be played e.g. once every 50ms.}}
