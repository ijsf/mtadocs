<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This function returns the current password required to join the server.

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
string getServerPassword ()
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns the current server password as a string if it has a password, if not it returns ''nil''.

==Example== 
This example prints the serverpassword to the player
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function viewPassword ( thePlayer, command )
  -- Put the password in a var
  local password = getServerPassword ()

  -- Check if the server has a password
  -- If the server has an password, echo it
  if password then
    outputChatBox ( "The server password is " .. password, thePlayer )
  
  -- Else print that there isnt any password
  else
    outputChatBox ( "The server doesn't have any password set", thePlayer )
