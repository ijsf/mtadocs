{{Server function}}

This function adds a new empty mapfile to an existing resource.


==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
xmlnode addResourceMap ( string filePath, [ int dimension = 0 ] )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments===
*'''filePath:''' The [[/filepath.md|filepath]] of the resource map in the following format: '''":resourceName/path"'''. 'resourceName' is the name of the resource the map file will be in, and 'path' is the path from the root directory of the resource to the file.
:For example, if you want to create a map file named 'manycars.map' in the resource 'cdm', it can be created from another resource this way: ''addResourceMap(":cdm/manycars.map")''.
:If you want to create the map file in the current resource, only the file path is necessary, e.g. ''addResourceMap("manycars.map")''.

'''NOTE:''' You can't add a map to a running resource.

===Optional Arguments=== 
{{OptionalArg}} 
*'''dimension:''' the [[/dimension.md|dimension]] in which the map's objects will be placed.

===Returns===
Returns the new map's root [[/xmlnode.md|xmlnode]] if the map was added successfully, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example just adds a map to a gamemode resource called "cdm".
