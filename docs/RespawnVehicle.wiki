{{Server function}}

This function respawns a vehicle according to its set respawn position, set by [[/setVehicleRespawnPosition.md|setVehicleRespawnPosition]] or the position and rotation it was created on. To spawn a vehicle to a specific location just once, [[/spawnVehicle.md|spawnVehicle]] can be used.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool respawnVehicle ( vehicle theVehicle )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/vehicle.md|vehicle]]:respawn}}
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theVehicle:''' The vehicle you wish to respawn

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the vehicle respawned successfully, ''false'' if the passed argument does not exist or is not a vehicle.

==Example== 
<!-- Explain what the example is in a single sentance -->
This example makes an exploded vehicle re-spawn after 5 seconds!
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function respawnExplodedVehicle()
	setTimer(respawnVehicle, 5000, 1, source)
end
addEventHandler("onVehicleExplode", getRootElement(), respawnExplodedVehicle)
