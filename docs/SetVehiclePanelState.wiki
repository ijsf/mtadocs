{{Server client function}}

This function allows you to change the state of one of the six panels vehicle's can have. When executed on the server-side resources, the damage will be synched for all players, whereas the change is only client-side if the function is used in a client resource. 

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool setVehiclePanelState ( vehicle theVehicle, int panelID, int state )</syntaxhighlight>

==Required Arguments==
*'''theVehicle:''' The [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] you would like to modify the panel of.
*'''panelID:''' An ID specifying the part of the vehicle. Possible values are:

*'''Cars:'''
** '''0:''' Front-left panel
** '''1:''' Front-right panel
** '''2:''' Rear-left panel
** '''3:''' Rear-right panel
** '''4:''' Windscreen
** '''5:''' Front bumper
** '''6:''' Rear bumper

*'''Planes:'''
**'''0:''' Engine Smoke (left engine for a Nevada or a Beagle)
**'''1:''' Engine Smoke (right engine for a Nevada or a Beagle)
**'''2:''' Rudder
**'''3:''' Elevators
**'''4:''' Ailerons
**'''5:''' Unknown
**'''6:''' Unknown

''NOTE:'' Settings are not applicable for all vehicles of these types, for instance panel 0 effects a Dodo, but does nothing to a hydra.

*'''state:''' How damaged the part is on the scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being undamaged and 3 being very damaged. How this is manifested depends on the panel and the vehicle.

==Returns==
Returns ''true'' if the panel state has been updated, ''false'' otherwise
