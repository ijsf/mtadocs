 
{{Client function}}
This function creates a static image using a .png image in the resource.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element guiCreateStaticImage ( float x, float y, float width, float height, string path, bool relative, [element parent = nil] )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
[[/Image:gui-staticimage.png.md|frame|Example GUI static image.]]
*'''x:''' A float of the 2D x position of the image on a player's screen. This is affected by the ''relative'' argument.
*'''y:''' A float of the 2D y position of the image on a player's screen. This is affected by the ''relative'' argument.
*'''width:''' A float of the width of the image. This is affected by the ''relative'' argument.
*'''height:''' A float of the height of the image. This is affected by the ''relative'' argument.
*'''path:''' The [[/filepath.md|filepath]] of the image file that is being loaded. 
*'''relative:''' This is whether sizes and positioning are relative. If this is ''true'', then all x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing measures relative to the parent.

===Optional Arguments=== 
{{OptionalArg}} 
*'''parent:''' This is the parent that the image is attached to. If the ''relative'' argument is true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent. If the ''relative'' argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.

===Returns===
Returns [[/element.md|element]] if image was created successfully, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example will display an image (imagename.png) on the client's (player's) screen.
<section name="Client-side script (example.lua)" class="client" show="true">
<code>
[lua]
function showClientImage()
   guiCreateStaticImage( 20, 200, 100, 100, "imagename.png", false )
end
addEventHandler( "onClientResourceStart", getResourceRootElement( getThisResource() ), showClientImage )
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>

<section name="meta.xml" class="server" show="true">
In this example [[/Meta.xml.md|Meta.xml]] is used to tell the server which files it will be using.
<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<meta>
  <info author="Yourname" version="1.0" />
  <script src="example.lua" type="client" />
  <file src="imagename.png" />
</meta>
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>
