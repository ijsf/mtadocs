The [[/account.md|account]] class represents a [[/player.md|player]]'s server account. You can get the [[/account.md|account]] object associated to any client using [[/getPlayerAccount.md|getPlayerAccount]].

Accounts are unique to each client and can be used to store information that is persistent across map changes and user sessions. Clients that join without an account are given a temporary 'guest' account. This can store information like any other account, but isn't saved across sessions.

When a user logs in or out, the account object assigned to them will change. As such, you must not assume that the account attached to a client remains constant during their session.

PHP code to check password hashes from the MTA server database is [[/Account_PHP.md|here.]]
