The [DFF](/DFF.md "wikilink") class represents a RenderWare Model File (DFF) loaded by the client, which can be used to replace the model associated to a certain model ID. After this has been done, the custom model is applied to all newly created entities from that ID.

Collision data can also be embedded in DFF files. At the moment, vehicle collision replacement works with DFF embedded collisions only.
