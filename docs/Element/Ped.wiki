The word "ped" is short for "pedestrian" and describes any person in GTA, be it a player or an NPC character. (And even though "pedestrian" doesn't technically apply to people that drive, they still fall under this name)

The [[/createPed.md|createPed]] function specifically creates an NPC, but all other ped functions work on both players and NPC's as they're pretty much the same thing to San Andreas.

The element type of a NPC is '''"ped"'''.
