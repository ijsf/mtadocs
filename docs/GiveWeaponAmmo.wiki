<!--
{{Needs_Checking|I cant actually think of a use for this function anymore.  giveWeapon is capable of doing everything this function does - and from my testing this function doesnt allow giving ammo to a weapon that shares ammo with another, e.g. giving AK-47 ammo when a player has M4 will not work. --[[/User:Talidan2.md|Talidan2]] 17:06, 29 July 2007 (CDT)}}
