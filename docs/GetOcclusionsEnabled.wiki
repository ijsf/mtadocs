{{Server client function}}
This function is used to get "occlusions enabled" state.

'''Note:''' Occlusions are used by GTA to enhance performance by hiding objects that are (normally) obscured by certain large buildings. However when [[/removeWorldModel.md|removeWorldModel]] is used they may also have the undesired effect of making parts of the map disappear. Disabling occlusions will fix that.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool getOcclusionsEnabled ( )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if occlusions are enabled, or ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example shows how to disable occlusions after the whole map has been cleared:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- Remove all world models
for i=700,20000 do
    removeWorldModel(i,10000,0,0,0)
end

-- Turn off occlusions with simple check
if getOcclusionsEnabled() then
    setOcclusionsEnabled( false )
end
</syntaxhighlight>
