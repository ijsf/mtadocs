 
{{Client function}}
This function sets the heard radio channel, even while not in a vehicle.
{{Note|This function sometimes doesn't work when setting the radio channel to another different from the current one due to unknown reasons. If you experience this issue, simply add setRadioChannel(0) at the beginning of the script, outside any function.}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setRadioChannel ( int ID )             
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''ID:''' The ID of the radio station you want to play.

{{SoundID}}

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if channel was set successfully, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example adds a command ''setradio'' which can be used to change the current radio station by ID.
<section name="Client" class="client" show="true">
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addCommandHandler ( "setradio",
    function ( command, stationID )
        local result = setRadioChannel ( tonumber( stationID ) )
        if result then -- if we had a valid ID
            outputChatBox ( "Changed your radio station to " .. getRadioChannelName ( tonumber ( stationID ) ) .. "!" )
        else
            outputChatBox ( "Invalid radio station ID, valid ones are 0-12." )
        end
