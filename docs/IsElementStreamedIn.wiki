{{Client function}}
This function checks whether an [[/element.md|element]] is currently streamed in (not virtualized) and are actual GTA objects in the world. You can force an element to be streamed in using [[/setElementStreamable.md|setElementStreamable]].<br>
{{Deprecated feature|3|1.0|
DP2 can return true even if this element is not fully streamed in. This can happen during the period when the vehicle/object model is loading while the element is not actually fully created yet.
}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool isElementStreamedIn ( element theElement )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
* '''theElement''': The [[/element.md|element]] to check whether is streamed in or not.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the passed element is currently streamed in, ''false'' if it is virtualized.

==Example==
This command shows you how many objects you have streamed in.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function checkTheObjects ( cmd )
	local amount = 0 -- When starting the command, we don't have any objects looped.
	for k,v in ipairs ( getElementsByType ( "object" ) ) do -- Looping all the objects in the server
		if isElementStreamedIn ( v ) then -- If the object is streamed in
			amount = amount + 1 -- It's an object more streamed in
		end
	end
	outputChatBox ( "You have currently " ..amount.. " objects streamed in." ) -- Send the player the amount of objects that are streamed in
end
addCommandHandler ( "checkobjects", checkTheObjects )
</syntaxhighlight>
Note: Objects can already stream from a very long distance, so even when you can't see some objects, they can still be returned.
