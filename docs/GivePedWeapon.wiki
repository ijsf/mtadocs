{{New feature/item|3.0141|1.4.1|6937|
This function gives the specified weapon to the specified ped. This function can't be used on players, use [[/giveWeapon.md|giveWeapon]] for that.

This function is mainly useful for client side created peds however you can use it on a server side ped, though note that the weapon wouldn't be synced between clients unless your script gives the weapon to the ped on every client.

There is an optional argument to specify ammunition and whether to set as the current weapon. If you don't specify an ammo value it will give 30 ammo by default and for a melee weapon you can specify just 1 or above.

*When setting ammo for [[/Weapon.md|weapons in slot]] 2,6,7,8,9 and the slot weapon is changing, the ammo is replaced
