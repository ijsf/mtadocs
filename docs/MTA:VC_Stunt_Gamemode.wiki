== Introduction ==

MTA's Stunt game mode has been around since version 0.2.2 of MTA:VC.

The aim of this game mode is to earn money via stunting. There are many spawn locations, each with different types of vehicles. There are no weapons in this gamemode.

== History ==

The initial release of Stunt was rather basic. It had 6 skins (versus the 7 of 0.5's Stunt), and featured only simple ramp placement.

MTA:VC 0.3 added additional ramps and fixed a rather nasty crash which plagued passengers that were exiting vehicles.

MTA:VC 0.4 synchronized money on the scoreboard, and fixed a rare issue on slower computers.

MTA:VC 0.5 was a rather major update. All vehicles and ramps were repositioned, RC Bandits were added, and some vehicles now had nitro enabled, bringing a new element to the stagnant Stunt gamemode.

The future of MTA:VC (and 0.5 in general) is uncertain. Previously, plans were to have GTA3 and VC run on the [[/Blue.md|Blue]] core, but plans seem to have dissipated. A future release of the 0.x core is also uncertain.

== 0.5 Stunt == 

In the current version of MTA:VC Stunt (0.5, at the time of writing), there are 7 playable spawns and a spectator mode. 

The spectator mode is somewhat unstable, though it has proven to be useful for server administrators.
