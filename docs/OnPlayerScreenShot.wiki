 
{{Server event}}
This event is triggered when the screen capture requested by [[/takePlayerScreenShot.md|takePlayerScreenShot]] has completed.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
resource theResource, string status, string imageData, int timestamp, string tag
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''theResource''': The resource which called [[/takePlayerScreenShot.md|takePlayerScreenShot]]
*'''status''': The status of the event which can be one of three values:
**''"ok"'' - The image capture was successful and imageData will contain a JPEG image.
**''"disabled"'' - The image capture failed because the player has disabled screen uploads.
**''"minimized"'' - The image capture failed because the player has minimized the screen. (i.e. alt-tabbed)
*'''imageData''': A string which contains the JPEG image data. This can be saved with the file functions, or sent to players with triggerClientEvent or even uploaded to a web site.
*'''timestamp''': The server tick count when the capture was taken.
*'''tag''': The tag string passed to [[/takePlayerScreenShot.md|takePlayerScreenShot]].

==Example== 
This example captures the screen of a random player every 2 seconds and shows it to everyone:

<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
--------------------------------------------------
-- Take screen shot every 2 seconds
function doTakeScreenShot()
    takePlayerScreenShot( getRandomPlayer(), 320, 200 )
end
setTimer(doTakeScreenShot, 2000, 0)

--------------------------------------------------
-- Receive screen shot result
addEventHandler( "onPlayerScreenShot", root,
    function ( theResource, status, pixels, timestamp, tag )
        triggerClientEvent( root, "onMyClientScreenShot", resourceRoot, pixels )  -- Relay to all players
    end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>

<section name="Client" class="client" show="true">
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
--------------------------------------------------
-- Turn image data into a texture at the client
addEvent("onMyClientScreenShot",true)
addEventHandler( "onMyClientScreenShot", resourceRoot,
    function( pixels )
        if image then
            destroyElement(image)
        end
        image = dxCreateTexture( pixels )
    end
)

--------------------------------------------------
-- Show image
addEventHandler( "onClientRender", root,
    function()
        if image then
            dxDrawImage( 100, 250, 320, 200, image )
        end
    end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>
