A **textitem** object represents a single area of text, much like a label does in standard GUI programing.

A text item can only be seen by players if it is added to a [textdisplay](/docs/textdisplay.md "wikilink") they are observers of using [textDisplayAddText](/textDisplayAddText.md "wikilink").
