*'''theVehicle:''' The [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] that you wish to get the door open ratio of.
*'''door:''' A whole number, 0 (hood), 1 (trunk), 2 (front left), 3 (front right), 4 (rear left), 5 (rear right)

==Returns==
Returns a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how open the door is. 0 is closed, and 1 is fully open. Returns ''false'' if invalid arguments are passed.
