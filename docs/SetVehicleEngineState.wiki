{{Server client function}}
This function turns a vehicle's engine on or off. Note that the engine will always be turned on when someone enters the driver seat, unless you override that behaviour with scripts.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setVehicleEngineState ( vehicle theVehicle, bool engineState )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''theVehicle''': The [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] you wish to change the engine state of.
*'''engineState''': A boolean value representing whether the engine will be turned on (''true'') or off (''false'').

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the vehicle's engine state was successfully changed, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
<section name="Serverside example" class="server" show="true">
This example will turn off a vehicle's engine when the driver gets out of the car.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function turnEngineOff ( theVehicle, leftSeat, jackerPlayer )
    -- if it's the driver who got out, and he was not jacked,
    if leftSeat == 0 and not jackerPlayer then
        -- turn off the engine
        setVehicleEngineState ( theVehicle, false )
    end
end
-- add 'turnEngineOff' as a handler for "onPlayerExitVehicle"
addEventHandler ( "onPlayerVehicleExit", getRootElement ( ), turnEngineOff )
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>
