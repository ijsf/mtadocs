int previousWeaponSlot, int currentWeaponSlot

*'''previousWeaponSlot''': An integer representing the previous weapon slot the player had before he switched.
*'''currentWeaponSlot''': An integer representing the new weapon slot the player has.

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the [[/player.md|player]] who changed his weapon. (Local player only)

==Cancel effect==
If this event is canceled, then the weapon will not be switched.

==Example== 
This example disables the use of aiming for the minigun.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function disableMinigunOnSwitch ( prevSlot, newSlot )
	if getPedWeapon(getLocalPlayer(),newSlot) == 38 then --if the switched weapon is the minigun
