===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the player is choking, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example checks if a random player is choking or not, and if so displays a message in the chat box.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
aPlayer = getRandomPlayer ( )
if ( isPlayerChoking ( aPlayer ) ) then
	outputChatBox ( getClientName ( aPlayer ) .. " is choking.  Keep away from those cigarettes!" )
end
