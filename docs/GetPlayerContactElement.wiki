{{Server client function}}
{{Deprecated|getPedContactElement|}}

This function detects the element a player is standing on. This can be a vehicle or an object.  Note that the server is unable to retrieve contact elements that are created clientside.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element getPlayerContactElement ( player thePlayer )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePlayer:''' The [[/player.md|player]] you want to get the [[/element.md|element]] he is touching from.

===Returns===
Returns an [[/object.md|object]] or a [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] if the player is standing on one, ''false'' if he is touching none or is a invalid player.

==Example== 
This clientside function outputs the name of the vehicle the specified player is standing on, or a message saying he isn't on one.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function outputContactVehicleMessage ( thePlayer )
  local elementStandingOn = getPlayerContactElement( thePlayer )
  if getElementType( elementStandingOn ) == "vehicle" then
    local vehicleName = getVehicleName( elementStandingOn )
    outputChatBox( "The player is standing on a " .. vehicleName .. "." )
  else
    outputChatBox( "The player isn't standing on any vehicle." )
  end
