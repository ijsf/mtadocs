This function makes a pedestrian reload their weapon.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool reloadPedWeapon ( ped thePed )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/ped.md|ped]]:reloadWeapon}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePed:''' The [[/ped.md|ped]] who will reload their weapon.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the pedestrian was made to reload, or ''false'' if invalid arguments were passed or that pedestrian has a weapon which cannot be reloaded.

Note: this will fail but return true if

1) the ped is crouched and moving

2) the ped is using a weapon without clip ammo (or minigun/flamethrower/fire
extinguisher)

3) the ped is using his weapon (shooting/aiming)

4) the ped moved while crouching recently

Due to these circumstances causing problems with this function

==Example== 
This example adds a 'reloadgun' console command that lets players reload their weapon.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function reloadGun ( sourcePlayer, command )
    reloadPedWeapon ( sourcePlayer )
end
addCommandHandler ( "reloadgun", reloadGun )
</syntaxhighlight>
