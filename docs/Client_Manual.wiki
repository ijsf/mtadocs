==Before you start==
Before you install Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas, first make sure that there are no modifications to GTA:SA installed. These will conflict with MTA. If you would like to keep your single player mods, you can create two installations by reinstalling San Andreas to a second folder on your hard drive.

Also make sure that you are running '''Windows XP''', '''Windows Vista''' (both 32-bits and 64-bits), '''Windows 7''' (both 32-bits and 64-bits), '''Windows 8''' (both 32-bits and 64-bits) or '''Windows 10''' (both 32-bits and 64-bits) and that your machine is capable of running the game in single player. Note that if you are running single player on the absolute minimum requirements, you will experience slowdowns in MTA as it takes up extra processing power.
{{Note| 
* MTA:SA will only work on GTA:SA '''v1.0'''. If you bought the game recently, it is likely that you have a later version.''' [[/Known_Issues_-_FAQ#Does_MTASA_work_with_v1.01_or_v2.00_of_GTA_San_Andreas.3F.md|(More info)]]
* If you have a Steam copy of GTA: San Andreas you should [[/Known_Issues_-_FAQ#I_have_the_Steam_version_of_GTA_San_Andreas._How_can_I_play_MTASA.3F.md|read this first]].

The easiest way to play the game is to click '''Browse Servers''' on the menu. If servers have not appeared already, press the '''Refresh''' button and MTA will scan for servers, displaying them as a list.

* Under the '''Name''' tab, each server's name is displayed.
* Under the '''Players''' tab, the number of players and the maximum capacity of the server is displayed, in the format of [Used Slots] / [Maximum Slots].
* The '''Ping''' tab displays the ping, or latency, between your machine and the server. Ping is a measure of the time it takes for "packets" of data to be received back from the server after sending them, so a higher ping means that you will experience more lag on that particular server. Generally, servers closest to your location should have the lowest pings.
* The '''Host''' is the IP address of the server. You can use this address in future to connect to the same server via the Quick Connect option on the main menu.

Each tab can be clicked to arrange the respective column in ascending or descending order.

For optimal performance and gameplay, look for the best balance between players and ping.

Once you have picked a server, select it and click the '''Connect''' button in the top right-hand corner of the dialog. If all goes well, you should connect to the server and automatically join the game.

==How to Play==

MTA:SA offers a comprehensive scripting system that allows map creators to customize many elements of the game in order to create their own innovative game modes. The game incorporates as many single player elements as possible but some aspects are different.

The only other people on the map are your opponents, or allies if it is a team game. You can talk with them using the chatbox located in the left-hand corner of the screen by pressing '''T'''. To chat only to your team members, press '''Y'''.

MTA's map editor allows map creators to add various GTA objects to their maps including roads, exploding barrels, ramps, buildings, hills and more. Not only this, but the objects can be scripted to move, change model and disappear. This offers a great deal of fun and variation to the gameplay. 

Holding Tab will display the scoreboard. By default, only names and pings are displayed, but scripts can add extra columns that are specific to the particular gamemode being played. For example, a deathmatch game mode would definitely have a column listing total kills, but the map creator may choose to add extra columns for the number of deaths you have and how long you have been playing for, in order to put your score into perspective.

==Default Controls==
