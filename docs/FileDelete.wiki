===Required Arguments===
*'''filePath:''' The [[/filepath.md|filepath]] of the file to delete in the following format: '''":resourceName/path"'''. 'resourceName' is the name of the resource the file is in, and 'path' is the path from the root directory of the resource to the file.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local newFile = fileCreate("test.txt")                -- attempt to create a new file
if (newFile) then                                     -- check if the creation succeeded
    fileWrite(newFile, "This is a test file!")        -- write a text line
    fileClose(newFile)                                -- close the file once you're done with it
