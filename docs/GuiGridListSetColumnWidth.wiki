{{Client function}}
 
This allows you to set the width of an existing column in a gridlist.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool guiGridListSetColumnWidth ( element gridList, int columnIndex, number width, bool relative )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''gridList:''' The grid list you want to add a column to
*'''columnIndex:''' Column ID of the size you want to change
*'''width:''' A float or integer of the width of the column depending on the '''relative''' argument.
*'''relative:''' A boolean defining whether '''width''' measurements will be relative to the Gridlist size, or absolute pixels.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the gridlist column width was successfully set, ''false'' if bad arguments were given.

==Example== 
This example creates a gridlist with one column that is too small to display. After the column has been successfully created, we give it a new width so you can see column.
<!-- Why these odd positions? Examples look cleaner with numbers like 250 instead of 249. Dunno whether I should change them.-->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">local gridlist = guiCreateGridList ( 332, 195, 286, 249, false ) 
local column = guiGridListAddColumn ( gridlist, "My column", 0 )

if column then
	guiGridListSetColumnWidth ( gridlist, column, 0.5, true)
end
</syntaxhighlight>
