{{Server client function}}

Checks if the file position is at the end of the file.
{{Note|Due to underlying C API restrictions this function may return false until an attempt to read further than the end of the file is made.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool fileIsEOF ( file theFile )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[/file.md|file]]:isEOF|isEOF}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''theFile:''' A handle to the file you wish to check.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the file position of the specified file is at the end of the file, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example opens the file test.txt and outputs its contents to the console.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local hFile = fileOpen("test.txt", true)       -- attempt to open the file (read only)
if hFile then                                  -- check if it was successfully opened
    local buffer
    while not fileIsEOF(hFile) do              -- as long as we're not at the end of the file...
        buffer = fileRead(hFile, 500)          -- ... read the next 500 bytes...
        outputConsole(buffer)                  -- ... and output them to the console
    end
    fileClose(hFile)                           -- close the file once we're done with it
else
    outputConsole("Unable to open test.txt")
end
</syntaxhighlight>

When you open a file, its file position is set to the beginning of the file. Each call to [[/fileRead.md|fileRead]] or [[/fileWrite.md|fileWrite]] moves the position ahead by the amount of bytes that were read/written. This way, by using ''fileIsEOF'' you can check if you've passed through the whole file.
