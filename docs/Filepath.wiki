A [[/filepath.md|filepath]] is a path that leads up to a file.  These are relative to the root directory of the resource it is being called from. 

{{New feature|3|1.0|It is also possible to use special filepaths in order to reference files from other resources.  This can be done with the following syntax
 :<resourceName>/file.ext

So, for example
 xmlLoadFile ( ":helpmanager/help.xml" )
}}

Note: Server side filepaths which refer to resources will work correctly even if the other resource is not running. However
client side filepaths require the target resource to be running.

=== Client file security ===
{{New feature|3.0110|1.1|
To protect a client file from being read by another server, prepend the filepath with @ when the file is created:
 xmlCreateFile ( "@:myresource/someinfo.xml" )
 fileCreate ( "@listofthings.txt" )
To read a private file, @ must also be prepended when the file is reopened:
 xmlLoadFile ( "@:myresource/someinfo.xml" )
 fileOpen ( "@listofthings.txt" )
Notes:
* The filepath without @ is read/writeable by all servers.
* The public and all the private versions of a particular filepath can exist at the same time. Which one is accessed depends upon the usage of @ and the server that is currently connected.
* The server file "mods/deathmatch/server-id.keys" is used for private file security. Keep a copy of it in a safe place!
