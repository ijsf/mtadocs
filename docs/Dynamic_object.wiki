{{Note|This page is under construction.}}

There should be description.

== Behaviour ==
* If object has originally 99999.0 Mass or TurnMass you can't move them like other dynamic objects (ex. beachball). Changing this property using [[/setObjectMass.md|setObjectMass]] doesn't change this effect.
* Some dynamic objects (propably only weapon models, ex. ID 355) doesn't have collision until GTA create [[/Element/Projectile.md|projectile]].
