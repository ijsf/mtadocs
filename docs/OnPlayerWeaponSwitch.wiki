 
{{Server event}}
This event is triggered whenever a player's equipped weapon '''slot''' changes. This means giveWeapon and takeWeapon will trigger this function if the equipped slot is forced to change. 

==Parameters== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int previousWeaponID, int currentWeaponID
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''previousWeaponID''': An [[/int.md|integer]] representing the [[/weapons.md|weapon]] that was switched from
*'''currentWeaponID''': An [[/int.md|integer]] representing the [[/weapons.md|weapon]] that was switched to

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the [[/player.md|player]] that switched his weapon.

==Example== 
This example disables use of the minigun upon switch.  It should be noted that this can be done more efficiently clientside.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
WeaponID = {
	[31] = true,
	[36] = true,
	[38] = true,
}

--add an event handler for onPlayerWeaponSwitch
addEventHandler ( 'onPlayerWeaponSwitch', getRootElement ( ),
	function ( previousWeaponID, currentWeaponID )
		if ( WeaponID[currentWeaponID] ) then
			toggleControl ( source, 'fire', false ) --disable the fire button
		else
			toggleControl ( source, 'fire', true ) --enable it
		end
	end
