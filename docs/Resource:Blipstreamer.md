Blip Streamer is a simple resource that allows you to stream your blips with any radius using a simple one function call.

**Please note that this resource was written for 1.0. It is mostly compatible with DP2 but will require minor changes to work properly.**

*Note: Blip Streamer hides blips by using clientside dimensions. Although setting streamable to “false” will restore a blip to its previous dimension, it may still intefere with scripts that use dimensions.*

Functions
---------

Blip Streamer exports two functions, both clientside and serverside:

-   [setBlipStreamable](/docs/Resource:Blipstreamer/setBlipStreamable.md "wikilink")
-   [getBlipStreamRadius](/docs/Resource:Blipstreamer/getBlipStreamRadius.md "wikilink")
