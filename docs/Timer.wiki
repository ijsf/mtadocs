A [[/timer.md|timer]] object refers to a timer set to execute a function a certain number of times with a specified delay.

Note that after a timer has completed all its iterations, it is destroyed and any stored pointers to it become invalid. Also timers are not under the ''resource'' hierarchy, because they are not elements, for instance, if you create a timer, it will not be destroyed when the resource in which it was created is stopped, so in this case you should kill the timer manually.
