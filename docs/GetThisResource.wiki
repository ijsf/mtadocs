{{Server client function}}

This function retrieves the resource from which the function call was made.

Note: every resource has a predefined global variable called ''resource'' that contains the resource pointer for that resource, in other words, the value that this function returns.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
resource getThisResource ( )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Returns===
Returns the resource in which the current script is.

==Example==
This example retrieves the current resource's root element and attaches it to an onResourceStart event handler. This causes the event handler to get called only when the ''current'' resource is started rather than when ''any'' resource is started, thereby reducing unnecessary overhead.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- get the root element of this resource (the resource that the script is a part of)
resourceRoot = getResourceRootElement(getThisResource()) 
--getThisResource() is the same thing as MTA's secret global variable 
--"resource" as explained in the note above. 

-- create a function to handle the command
function onResourceCommand()
   local thisResource = getThisResource()
   local resourceName = getResourceName(thisResource)
   outputChatBox("You are in the " .. resourceName .. " resource!")
end

-- add the event handler
addCommandHandler("what", onResourceCommand)
</syntaxhighlight>
