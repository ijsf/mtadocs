{{Server client function}}
{{Note box|This function is equivalent to the [[/Vector2.md|Vector2]] class ''getLength'' method when used with a vector that holds the direction and distance between two points. In other words, it produces exactly the same result as substracting the points' coordinates and getting the length of the result vector.}}

This function returns the distance between two 2 dimensional points using the pythagorean theorem.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">float getDistanceBetweenPoints2D ( float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2 )</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
* '''x1''': The X position of the first point
* '''y1''': The Y position of the first point
* '''x2''': The X position of the second point
* '''y2''': The Y position of the second point

===Returns===
Returns a float containing the 2D distance between the two points. Returns ''false'' if invalid parameters are passed.

==Example==
<section name="Server and client" class="both" show="true">
This example gets the distance between two vehicles, stored in variables ''vehicle1'' and ''vehicle2''.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
vehicle1x, vehicle1y, vehicle1z = getElementPosition ( vehicle1 )
vehicle2x, vehicle2y, vehicle2z = getElementPosition ( vehicle2 )
outputChatBox ( "The map distance between vehicle1 and vehicle2 is ", getDistanceBetweenPoints2D ( vehicle1x, vehicle1y, vehicle2x, vehicle2y ) )
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>
