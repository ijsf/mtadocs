{{Client function}} 
 
This function can be used to disable streaming for an element. This will make sure the element is not virtualized (streamed out from GTA) when the player moves far away from it. This function only works in elements with a physical representation in the world (entities), such as [[/player.md|players]], [[/ped.md|peds]], [[/vehicle.md|vehicles]] and [[/object.md|objects]].
{{Tip|'''Always use this function with caution'''. Not doing so can cause the following problems:
* There is a limit of elements that can be streamed in safely for every GTA entity type. If you bypass said limit by using this function, the client can experience problems of disappearing objects and unstability when trying to stream in new elements of that type.
* In general, if you disable too many elements (of the same type or not) to stream out, GTA will always try to render them, so it can cause a noticeable FPS drop.}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setElementStreamable ( element theElement, bool streamable ) 
</syntaxhighlight>
{{New feature/item|3.0141|1.4.0|6987|{{OOP||[[/element.md|element]]:setStreamable|streamable|isElementStreamable}}}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theElement:''' The element you wish to set the streaming of
*'''streamable:''' ''true'' if this element should stream in/out like normal, ''false'' if it should always be streamed in.

===Returns===
Returns whether the element could be set to be streamable.

==Example==
This example creates an [[/object.md|object]] at the center of the map which will always be streamed in when the resource which contains it starts.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local function testNonStreamableObjects()
    local object = createObject ( 1097, 0, 0, 5 )
    setElementStreamable ( object, false ) -- Make the object always be streamed in
end
addEventHandler ( "onClientResourceStart", resourceRoot, testNonStreamableObjects )
</syntaxhighlight>
