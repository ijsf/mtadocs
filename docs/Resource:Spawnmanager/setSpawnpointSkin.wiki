{{Server function}}
This function sets the skin that players will spawn with when they spawn at the specified spawnpoint.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setSpawnpointSkin ( spawnpoint theSpawnpoint, int skin )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theSpawnpoint:''' The spawnpoint you want to change skin of.
*'''skin:''' An [[/int.md|int]] corresponding to the ID of the desired skin. See [[/Character Skins.md|Character Skins]].

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the skin was successfully set, ''false'' if invalid arguments were passed.

==Example==
This code alters all existing spawnpoints so everyone spawns as construction workers.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- get a table of all spawnpoints
local allSpawnpoints = getElementsByType("spawnpoint")
-- for each spawnpoint,
for index, spawn in ipairs (allSpawnpoints) do
    -- change the spawn skin to 27
    call(getResourceFromName("spawnmanager"), "setSpawnpointSkin", spawn, 27 )
end
