Map Limits is a resource that allows defining points in a .map file to border a map. A player outside the border area will lose health until he dies or returns to the game area.

==Usage==
Syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
<maplimit>
	<point x="" y="" />
	<point x="" y="" />
	<point x="" y="" />
</maplimit>
</syntaxhighlight>

When using maplimits in ones map, at least three points must be made.<br>
<br>
Note that the sequence of points <b>matters</b>. Start in the bottom left corner and work counter-clockwise. 

For example, this would create a square shaped border:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
<point x="0" y="0" />
<point x="1" y="0" />
<point x="1" y="1" />
<point x="0" y="1" />
</syntaxhighlight>
<br>
While this would create two triangles:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
<point x="0" y="0" />
<point x="1" y="1" />
<point x="0" y="1" />
<point x="1" y="0" />
</syntaxhighlight>
