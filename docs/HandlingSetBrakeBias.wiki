{{Server function}}
Sets the brake bias of a handling element. This determines how the braking power is distributed over the wheels.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool handlingSetBrakeBias ( handling theHandling, float bias )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''theHandling:''' the handling of which you want to change the brake bias.
*'''bias:''' the bias to set. This is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 will put all the braking power in the rear wheels, and the front wheels will not brake at all. A value of 1 has only the front wheels brake. With a bias of 0.5, front and back wheels have the same braking power.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' on success, ''false'' in case of failure.

==Example==

--TODO
