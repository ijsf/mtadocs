{{Server function}}
This function stops a running resource.<br>
'''Note:''' This function does not stop the resource immediately, so don't expect that it starts stopping until the [[/onResourceStop.md|onResourceStop]] event for that resource is triggered. This happens after the scripts are done executing for this server frame.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool stopResource ( resource theResource )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/resource.md|resource]]:stop}}
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theResource:''' the [[/resource.md|resource]] that should be stopped.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the resource was stopped, ''false'' if the stopping failed, or an invalid resource was passed.

==Example== 
This function stops all running resources except the current one.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function stopAllResources()
    -- we store a table of resources
    local allResources = getResources()
    -- for each one of them,
    for i, resource in ipairs(allResources) do
        -- if it's running, and it is not the current resource
        if ( getResourceState(resource) == "running" ) and ( resource ~= getThisResource() ) then
            -- then stop it
            stopResource(resource)
        end
    end
end
</syntaxhighlight>
