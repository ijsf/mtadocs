<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function checkMap ( thePlayer )
    local mapName = getMapName() -- get the maps name
	if mapName and mapName ~= "None" then -- if map name was set and it isn't "None" (default map name)
        outputChatBox( "You're playing map called \"" .. mapName .. "\"", thePlayer ) -- print out the map name
    else -- there was no name so tell that to player
        outputChatBox( "You're playing an unnamed map.", thePlayer ) -- print out the message
    end
end
