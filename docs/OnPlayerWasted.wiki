<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- register player_Wasted as a handler for onPlayerWasted
function player_Wasted ( ammo, attacker, weapon, bodypart )
	-- if there was an attacker
	if ( attacker ) then
		-- we declare our variable outside the following checks
		local tempString
		-- if the element that killed him was a player,
		if ( getElementType ( attacker ) == "player" ) then
			-- put the attacker, victim and weapon info in the string
			tempString = getPlayerName ( attacker ).." killed "..getPlayerName ( source ).." ("..getWeaponNameFromID ( weapon )..")"

end
addEventHandler ( "onPlayerWasted", getRootElement(), player_Wasted )
</syntaxhighlight>


And another example, this will spawn you in the middle of GTA SA world (x=0, y=0, z=3) after 2 seconds of your death
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onPlayerWasted", getRootElement( ),
	function()
		setTimer( spawnPlayer, 2000, 1, source, 0, 0, 3 )
	end
)
