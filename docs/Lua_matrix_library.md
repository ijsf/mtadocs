The Lua matrix library is a collection of stuff to help with matrix math. The original Lua source for that is here: [Lua matrix library on github](https://github.com/davidm/lua-matrix)

However, we recommend you use the following files as they have been changed slightly to work better with MTA:

:\*[matrix.lua](http://mtasa-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/%5Beditor%5D/editor_main/client/matrix.lua)

:\*[complex.lua](http://mtasa-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/%5Beditor%5D/editor_main/client/complex.lua)
