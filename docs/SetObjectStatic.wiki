{{Client function}}
{{Deprecated|setElementFrozen|}}

Makes an object static or non-static. Static objects are rock solid in one place, unaffected by gravity and pushing. Nonstatic objects can fall, be pushed around etc.

'''Note1:''' Not all objects that are static by default can be made nonstatic.<br\>
'''Note2:''' Dynamic objects with a "destroyed" state are still destroyable. Use [[/isElementOnScreen.md|isElementOnScreen]] to detect, destroy, and recreate these objects.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setObjectStatic ( object theObject, bool toggle )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''theObject:''' the object whose behaviour you want to change.
*'''toggle:''' ''true'' makes the object static, ''false'' makes it nonstatic.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if successful, ''false'' otherwise.
