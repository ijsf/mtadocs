== Game processing order ==
Here is an overview to show the order in which things get done during an average frame of playing MTA.

The [[/onClientPreRender.md|onClientPreRender]] event is triggered after GTA updates the world, and is the ideal place to do dxDraws that are in some way attached to world elements.

The [[/onClientHUDRender.md|onClientHUDRender]] event is triggered before GTA renders the in-game HUD, so it the best place to apply any full screen effects that you want 'behind' the HUD.
