binary ipl files can be a huge pain. they contain the majority of the object placement for San Andreas and they reside inside the gta3.img file. After finding a nice little app to read them without needing a hex editor, i copied them all into a text file.

Use this if you would like to find the coords of certain objects to use in your scripts (ie phone booths, telephone poles, vending machines, etc)

this is just the binary ipl files, there are more ipl files outside the gta3.img
