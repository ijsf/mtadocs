 
{{Server function}}
This function checks to see if an [[/account.md|account]] is a guest account. A guest account is an account automatically created for a user when they join the server and deleted when they quit or login to another account. Data stored in a guest account is not stored after the player has left the server. As a consequence, this function will check if a player is logged in or not.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool isGuestAccount ( account theAccount )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[/account.md|account]]:isGuest|guest|}} 
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theAccount:''' The account you want to check to see if it is a guest account.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the account is a guest account, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This example shows how you could create a ''call_admin'' function that only could be run by registered users.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function callAdmin ( playerSource )
    -- get the account of the user trying to use this function first
    sourceAccount = getPlayerAccount ( playerSource )
    -- if they're a guest
    if isGuestAccount ( sourceAccount ) then
        -- tell them to register
        outputConsole ( "Please register to use this function!", playerSource )
    else
        -- your code to call the admin would go here
    end
end
-- attach the function 'callAdmin' as a handler to the command "call_admin"
addCommandHandler ( "call_admin", callAdmin )
</syntaxhighlight>
