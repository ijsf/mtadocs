{{Client function}}

Creates a patch of fire that will spread a bit and die out after a while. Because it's a client side only function, other players won't see it, so custom events or custom objects will be needed to make a fire visible to some players.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua"> )</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''x, y, z:''' the coordinates when the initial patch of fire will be created.

===Optional Arguments===
*'''size:''' a float value indicating the size of the initial patch of fire. It will also make the fire to stay alive more or less time.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if successful, ''false'' if bad arguments were passed or the limit of active fires was reached. There can be a maximum of 60 active fires.

== Example ==

This example adds a /fire command, which creates a patch of fire in the position of the player that types it.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local function burn(commandName, theSize)
   if tonumber(theSize) then
        local x, y, z = getElementPosition(getLocalPlayer())
        createFire(x, y, z, tonumber(theSize))
        outputChatBox("Burn, buuuuurn >:]")
   else
        outputChatBox("Syntax: /fire <size>")
   end
end
addCommandHandler("fire", burn)
</syntaxhighlight>
