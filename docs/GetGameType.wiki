 
{{Server function}}<!-- Change this to "Client function" or "Server function" appropriately-->
<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This function retrieves the current gametype as set by [[/setGameType.md|setGameType]]. The game type is displayed in the server browser next to the server's name.

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
string getGameType ()
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns the gametype as a string. If no gametype is set it returns ''nil''.

==Example== 
This example sends a message to player when he joins, if the current game type is Race.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function playerJoinHandler( )
   if getGameType() == "Race" then
      outputChatBox( "Ready... Get set... GO!!", source )
   end
end
addEventHandler( "onPlayerJoin", getRootElement(), playerJoinHandler )
</syntaxhighlight>
