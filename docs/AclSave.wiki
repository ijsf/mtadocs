 
{{Server function}} 
<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
The ACL XML file is automatically saved whenever the ACL is modified, but the automatic save can be delayed by up to 10 seconds for performance reasons. Calling this function will force an immediate save. 

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool aclSave ()
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP|This function is a static function underneath the ACL class.|[[/ACL.md|ACL]].save||}}
===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns ''true'' if the ACL was successfully changed, ''false'' or ''nil'' if it could not be saved for some reason, ie. file in use.

==Example== 
<!-- Explain what the example is in a single sentance -->
This example saves the ACL when somebody types "/save-acl".
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function saveACL ( thePlayer, command ) -- Function header. Also where thePlayer is defined.
	local saved = aclSave() -- Save the ACL
		if ( saved ) then -- If it was successfully saved then...
			outputChatBox ( "ACL was successfully saved.", thePlayer, 255, 0, 0 ) -- Output it saved
		else -- If it wasn't saved for whatever reason then...
			outputChatBox ( "An unexpected error occured.", thePlayer, 255, 0, 0 ) -- Output it didn't save
		end
end
addCommandHandler ( "save-acl", saveACL ) -- Make it trigger for "/save-acl".
