{{Client function}}

This function gets the player element of the client running the current script. 

{{New feature/item|3.0110|1.1||
You can use the predefined variable '''localPlayer''' instead of typing getLocalPlayer()
}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
player getLocalPlayer ( )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Returns===
Returns the local [[/player.md|player]] element.

==Example== 
'''Example 1:''' This client side function outputs the player's current location to the console.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- we get the local player (we do this outside of the function body so it isn't retrieved every time
-- the function is called, since the local player never changes)

function outputLocalPlayerPosition ( )
	-- get the local player's position
	local px, py, pz = getElementPosition ( getLocalPlayer ( ) )
	-- output it to the console
	outputConsole ( "Your location: " .. px .. " " .. py .. " " .. pz )
end
</syntaxhighlight>

'''Example 2:''' This client side script makes the local player's camera flash red after being hit.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function flashRed ( )
	-- fade out the local player's camera to red during a second
	fadeCamera( false, 1.0, 255, 0, 0 )
	-- set a 500 ms (0.5 sec) timer to fade it back in before it has completely faded out
	setTimer( fadeCamera, 500, 1, true, 1.0 )
end
-- we attach our 'flashRed' function to be a handler of "onClientPlayerDamage" when its source (that is, the hit player) is the local player
addEventHandler( "onClientPlayerDamage", getLocalPlayer ( ), flashRed )
</syntaxhighlight>
