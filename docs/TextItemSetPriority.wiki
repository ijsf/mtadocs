{{Server function}}
{{Needs_Example}}
This function sets the priority for a text item.  Priority is the importance of sending updated text to the client. The system is implemented as 3 queues, with the ''high'' queue being emptied before the ''medium'' queue is processed, and with one update sent per server frame. Hence, if you set all your text items to ''medium'' priority it has the same effect as if you set them all to ''high'' or ''low''.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
void textItemSetPriority ( textitem theTextItem, string priority )              
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theTextItem:''' The text item you wish to set priority to.
*'''priority:''' The priority you wish to set to the item, which can be ''"high"'', ''"medium"'', or ''"low"'' respective of their priority.
