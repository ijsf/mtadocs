This page contains a rough outline of the Multi Theft Auto roadmap. The roadmap is used to plan future versions and the changes they contain, specifying a general development direction for the software. It is different from the bugtracker roadmap in the sense that it provides a general description of each version, so that issues on the bugtracker can be targetted at specific versions more easily.

Versions are defined as follows: ''major''.''minor''.''revision'' according to the GNU version numbering scheme. Revision releases (with identical minor versions, e.g. 1.0 and 1.0.1) will only contain fixes and no significant code restructuring, reimplementations or other new features or improvements, compared to the previous revision. Minor releases (e.g. 1.0 and 1.1) will be used to introduce new features and any aforementioned improvements.

The development ''trunk'' will always contain the current version. Work for future versions can be done in separate branches, and will only be merged when the trunk is at the version in which the work was expected to be introduced.

Our current roadmap is located on the [http://bugs.mtasa.com/roadmap_page.php Mantis Roadmap].
