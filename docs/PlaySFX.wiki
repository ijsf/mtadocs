{{Warning|Many players use versions of GTA:SA (especially pirated versions) that have audio files full of zeros so that they can compresses better in their ''AUDIO\SFX\'' folder. (They lack any data) 
In case of these invalid audio files, this function returns ''false''.

It also returns ''false'' when trying to play a track deleted in the recent GTA: SA Steam patches (and if the client is using a Steam GTA: SA copy).|true}}
