In many cases it is necessary to access files stored on the local disk from browsers.

{{New feature/item|3.0151|1.5.1|7439|
==Scheme format==
<code>http://mta/resourceName/file.extension</syntaxhighlight>
* '''resourceName''': The resource name, ''local'' is a special name for the current resource
* '''file.extension''': The file path within ''resourceName''

You can use this scheme format for [[/loadBrowserURL.md|loadBrowserURL]] as well as in HTML files e.g. <img> tags.


{{Requirements|1.5.0-9.07439|n/a|}}

===Example 1===
<code>http://mta/myResource/assets/myImage.png</syntaxhighlight>

===Example 2===
<code>http://mta/local/myImage.png</syntaxhighlight>
Refers to the file ''myImage.png'' in the current resource

{{Deprecated_feature|3.0151|1.5.0-7439|
Before build 1.5.0-7439 local files were accessed using the mtalocal:// scheme. This scheme has been deprecated now, but throws a warning and should not be used any longer for this reason.
Nevertheless, it still works for backward compatibility, but should be replaced as soon as possible. '''Don't forget to set min_mta_version though (when using the new scheme).'''
