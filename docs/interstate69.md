You should use the settings or info system for storing the settings. Don't use the map format :) [eAi](/docs/user-eai.md "wikilink") 20:14, 5 November 2007 (CST) Why is it called **thearea** rather than **gamearea** ? [eAi](/docs/user-eai.md "wikilink") 20:15, 5 November 2007 (CST)

Im still waiting for proper documentation before i even try to convert it to the settings system. thearea is changed to gamearea now :) [Lucif3r](/docs/user-lucif3r.md "wikilink") 03:31, 6 November 2006 (GMT+1)

What documentation are you missing? [eAi](/docs/user-eai.md "wikilink") 07:33, 6 November 2007 (CST)

-   The meta.xml side of the settings system remains completely undocumented [Talidan2](/docs/user-talidan2.md "wikilink") 09:12, 6 November 2007 (CST)

Is there any way you can use the standard 'vehicle' tag rather than tehVehicle? Would look better :) [eAi](/docs/user-eai.md "wikilink") 06:16, 15 November 2007 (CST)

Not as long as <vehicle /> tags autocreates when the map starts. I think its fine as it is atm tbh, but I might change it in the future tho. --[Lucif3r](/docs/user-lucif3r.md "wikilink") 01:24, 28 November 2007 (CST)
