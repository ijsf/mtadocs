{{Server client function}}
This function checks if a value is an [[/element.md|element]] or not.
{{Note|This function is not reliable as element ids are eventually recycled. Always make sure you nil variables containing an element after calling [[/destroyElement.md|destroyElement]] or handle [[/onElementDestroy.md|onElementDestroy]] for players and elements that might be destroyed by another resource}}
==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool isElement ( var theValue )</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
* '''theValue''': The value that we want to check.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the passed value is an element, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
This serverside function kills a player when it's passed his name or his element.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function killPlayer2 ( argument )
	-- if the argument is an element, and also a player,
	if isElement( argument ) and getElementType( argument ) == "player" then
		-- kill him
		killPed ( argument )

	-- if it isn't an element, but a string, it could be a name
	elseif type ( argument ) == "string" then
		-- retrieve the player with that name
		local playerElement = getPlayerFromName( argument )
		-- if a player with such a name exists,
		if playerElement then
			-- kill him
			killPed ( playerElement )
		end
	end
end
