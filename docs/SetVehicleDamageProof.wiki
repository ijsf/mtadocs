<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setVehicleDamageProof ( vehicle theVehicle, bool damageProof )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/vehicle.md|vehicle]]:setDamageProof|damageProof|isVehicleDamageProof}}
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theVehicle:''' The [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] you wish to make damage proof.
*'''damageProof:''' ''true'' is damage proof, ''false'' is damageable.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the vehicle was set damage proof succesfully, ''false'' if the arguments are invalid or it failed.

==Example==
This example spawns a vehicle and sets it damage proof immediately.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
newvehicle = createVehicle(602, 0, 0, 6)
setVehicleDamageProof(newvehicle, true)
</syntaxhighlight>
