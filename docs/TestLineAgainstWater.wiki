{{Client function}}
This function checks to see if a line between two points collides with the water. This is similar to [[/processLineOfSight.md|processLineOfSight]], but only collides with water. Waves are taken into account when testing the line.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool float float float testLineAgainstWater ( float startX, float startY, float startZ, float endX, float endY, float endZ )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''startX, startY, startZ:''' the position of the starting point of the line.
*'''endX, endY, endZ:''' the position of the end point of the line.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' and the position of the intersection point of the line and the water surface if there is a collision, or ''false'' if there is no collision.

==Example==
This code snippet adds a /isanywaterbelowme command, which checks if there is water at 500 units below the ground at the position of the player who types it.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function checkForWater()
    if isPedOnGround(localPlayer) then
        local px, py, pz = getElementPosition(localPlayer)
        if testLineAgainstWater(px, py, pz, px, py, pz - 500) then
            outputChatBox("Yes, there is water below you.")
        else
            outputChatBox("This place looks a bit dry.")
        end
    end
end
addCommandHandler("isanywaterbelowme", checkForWater)
</syntaxhighlight>
