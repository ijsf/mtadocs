{{Server client function}}
{{Deprecated|getPedTarget}}

This function is used to get the element a [[/player.md|player]] is currently targeting.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element getPlayerTarget ( player thePlayer )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''thePlayer:''' The [[/player.md|player]] whose target you want to retrieve.

===Returns===
Returns the [[/element.md|element]] that's being targeted, or ''false'' if there isn't one.

This is only effective on physical GTA elements, namely:
* Players
* Vehicles
* Objects

==Example==
This example blows up any vehicle a player targets (aims at).
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function playerTargetCheck ( )
    local target
    for i, thePlayer in ipairs ( getElementsByType("player") ) do  -- iterate over all players
        target = getPlayerTarget ( thePlayer )                     -- get the target of the current player
        if ( target ) then                                         -- if there was a target
            if ( getElementType ( target ) == "vehicle" ) then     -- and the target is a vehicle
                blowVehicle ( target )                             -- blow it up
            end
        end
    end
end
setTimer ( playerTargetCheck, 1000, 0 )                            -- call the check function every second

''Note: A more efficient way to do this would be to use the [[/onPlayerTarget.md|onPlayerTarget]] event.''
