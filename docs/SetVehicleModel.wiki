{{Server client function}}

{{Deprecated|setElementModel}}
This function changes the model of the specified vehicle. If the new vehicle model has less seats than the current model, any excess passengers will be removed from the vehicle.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setVehicleModel ( vehicle theVehicle, int model )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''theVehicle:''' the vehicle you want to change the model of.
*'''model:''' the new model you want to set.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the new model was successfully applied, ''false'' if it failed.

==Example==
This very simple example that allows a player to change the vehicle he is in with a console command. In actual gamemodes the function can be used for more interesting things, like vehicle change pickups.
<section class="server" name="Server" show="true">
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addCommandHandler("changeveh",
    function(thePlayer, command, newModel)
        local theVehicle = getPlayerOccupiedVehicle(thePlayer)  -- get the vehicle the player is in
        newModel = tonumber(newModel)                           -- try to convert the string argument to a number
        if theVehicle and newModel then                         -- make sure the player is in a vehicle and specified a number
            setVehicleModel(theVehicle, newModel)
        end
    end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>
After the above code is executed, a player can get in any vehicle and execute e.g. the command "/changeveh 520" to change it into a hydra.
