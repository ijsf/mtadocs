This example will output in the chatbox whether the vehicle is vulnerable to damage or not when a player enters in it.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function checkVulnerability(theVehicle)
   if isVehicleDamageProof(theVehicle) == true then
            outputChatBox("This vehicle is not vulnerable to damage", source)
