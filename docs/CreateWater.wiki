{{Server client function}}

Creates an area of [[/water.md|water]].

The largest possible size of a water area is 5996&#0215;5996. Also be aware that the function will change all x and y coordinates you specify into even integer numbers if necessary: this is because of a limitation of San Andreas.

You are able to give the water a shallow water effect, which practically changes the water invisible to the eye. However, all elements still work the same way as without the shallow effect - allowing swimming, diving, vehicles to sink, etc.
{{Note|X and Y positions will be changed to an even integer. i.e. -2, 0, 2, 4 etc.}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''x1, y1, z1:''' position of bottom left (south-west) corner.
*'''x2, y2, z2:''' position of bottom right (south-east) corner.
*'''x3, y3, z3:''' position of top left (north-west) corner.
''Note: Only 3 coords creates a triangle''

===Optional Arguments===
*'''x4, y4, z4:''' position of top right (north-east) corner.
*'''bShallow:''' gives the water a shallow water effect.

===Returns===
Returns a water element if successful, ''false'' otherwise. The water element can be repositioned with [[/setElementPosition.md|setElementPosition]] and destroyed with [[/destroyElement.md|destroyElement]].
