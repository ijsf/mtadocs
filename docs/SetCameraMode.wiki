{{Note|remember to set players camera mode back to "player" on resource unload, or you will encounter the invisible player 'bug' if players camera is still set to fixed.}}

This function allows you to set a player's camera to either follow him or be fixed at a certain position.

bool setCameraMode ( player thePlayer, string mode )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePlayer:''' The player whose camera you wish to modify.
*'''mode:''' The mode to be set. It has the following possible values:
** '''"player":''' Sets the camera to follow a player.
** '''"fixed":''' Fixes the camera in a set position/rotation.
 
===Returns===
Returns a [[/bool.md|bool]] with a value of ''true'' if the function was successful, ''false'' otherwise.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function spawnScreen ( source )
        setCameraMode ( source, "fixed" )                                     -- Make the camera fixed (instead of following the player)
        setTimer ( setCameraPosition, 1000, 1, source, 160.15, -1951.68, 50 ) -- Set the coordinates of the camera
        setTimer ( setCameraLookAt, 1000, 1, source, 165, -1951.68, 50 )      -- Make the camera look at specified coordinates
        bindKey ( source, "F1", "down", "Spawn as Vagos", spawnVagos )        -- Bind spawn key (function spawnVagos is not given here)
