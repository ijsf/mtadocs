{{Server client function}}

This function checks if the last completed event was cancelled. This is mainly useful for custom events created by scripts. 

Events can be cancelled using [[/cancelEvent.md|cancelEvent]], this indicates that the resource which triggered the event should do whatever it can to reverse any changes made by whatever caused the event. See [[/triggerEvent.md|triggerEvent]] for a more detailed explanation of this.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool wasEventCancelled ( )   
</syntaxhighlight>

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the event was cancelled, ''false'' if it wasn't or doesn't exist.

==Example== 
This example implements a custom event ''onFlagPickup'' that would be triggered if an ''onMarkerHit'' event was triggered on a marker whose parent was a ''flag'' element. If the event isn't canceled then an element data value is set on the player.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEvent ( "onFlagPickup", true )

function flagHitcheck ( thePlayer )
    parentElement = getElementParent ( source ) -- get the parent of the marker
    if ( getElementType ( parentElement ) == "flag" ) then -- if it was a flag element then
        triggerEvent ( "onFlagPickup", source, thePlayer ) -- trigger our onFlagPickup event
        
        if ( not wasEventCancelled() ) then -- if handlers for 'onFlagPickup' didn't cancel it then
            setElementData ( thePlayer, "hasFlag", true ) -- set that the player picked up the flag
        end
    end
end
addEventHandler ( "onMarkerHit", getRootElement(), flagHitCheck )
</syntaxhighlight>
