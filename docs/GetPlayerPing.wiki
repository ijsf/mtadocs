{{OOP||[[/player.md|player]]:getPing|ping|}}
===Required Arguments===
*'''thePlayer''': The [[/player.md|player]] whose ping you want to determine.

===Returns===
Returns the ping as an [[/int.md|int]], or ''false'' if the player is invalid.

==Example==
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
This example checks every players ping every 5 seconds and if it's over 500 they get kicked.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function kickPing() -- Creates a function called kickPing
	for i, player in ipairs(getElementsByType("player")) do -- Loop every player
		if (getPlayerPing(player) >= 500) then -- If their ping is over 500
			kickPlayer(player, "Ping over 500!") -- Kick them
		end
	end
end

        if (ping > 100) then                          -- if it's higher than 100...
