{{Server function}}
This function frees a database query handle. dbFree only needs to be used if a result has not been obtained with [[/dbPoll.md|dbPoll]]

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool dbFree ( handle queryHandle )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||queryHandle:free}}
===Required Arguments===
*'''queryHandle:''' A query handle previously returned from [[/dbQuery.md|dbQuery]]

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the handle was successfully freed, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
=====These examples show when dbFree should be used:=====
<div style="margin-left:20px">
Required because [[/dbPoll.md|dbPoll]] was not called:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local qh = dbQuery( connection, "SELECT * FROM table_name" )
dbFree ( qh )
</syntaxhighlight>
Required because [[/dbPoll.md|dbPoll]] was not called:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function aaa()
    dbQuery( myCallback, connection, "SELECT * FROM table_name" )
end

function myCallback(qh)
    dbFree ( qh )
end
</syntaxhighlight>

Required because [[/dbPoll.md|dbPoll]] is called, but the result was not ready and no more attempts will be made:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local qh = dbQuery( connection, "SELECT * FROM table_name" )
local result = dbPoll( qh, 10 )     -- Get result with a timeout of 10ms
if result == nil then
    result = dbPoll( qh, 10 )       -- Try again to get result with a timeout of 10ms
    if result == nil then
        dbFree( qh )                -- Give up
    end
end
</syntaxhighlight>
</div><br>
=====These examples show when dbFree should NOT be used:=====
<div style="margin-left:20px">
Not required because [[/dbPoll.md|dbPoll]] was called with a -1 timeout:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local qh = dbQuery( connection, "SELECT * FROM table_name" )
local result = dbPoll( qh, -1 )    -- Wait until result has been gotten
</syntaxhighlight>

Not required because [[/dbPoll.md|dbPoll]] was called from the callback:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function aaa()
    dbQuery( myCallback, connection, "SELECT * FROM table_name" )
end

function myCallback(qh)
    local result = dbPoll( qh, 0 )  -- Timeout doesn't matter here because the result will always be ready
end
</syntaxhighlight>
</div>
