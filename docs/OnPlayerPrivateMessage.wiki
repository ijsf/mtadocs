{{Server event}}
This event is triggered when a player sends a private message with ''msg'' command.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
string message, player recipient
</syntaxhighlight> 
*'''message''': A string representing the private message typed.
*'''recipient''': The [[/player.md|player]] to whom the message is being sent.

==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the [[/player.md|player]] who sent the private message.

==Cancel effect==
If this event is [[/Event_system#Canceling.md|canceled]], the game's chat system won't deliver the message. You may use [[/outputChatBox.md|outputChatBox]] to send the messages then.

==Example== 
This example blocks players sending a PM to a player named "Bob".
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function blockPM(msg,r)
	if (getPlayerName(r) == "Bob") then -- If they sent a PM to "Bob"
		cancelEvent() -- Then cancel it
		outputChatBox("Bob is not accepting PM's at this time.",source,255,0,0) -- And output it was cancelled.
	end
end
addEventHandler("onPlayerPrivateMessage",getRootElement(),blockPM)
</syntaxhighlight>
