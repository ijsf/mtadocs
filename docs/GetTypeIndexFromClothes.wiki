  local clothesIndex = 1
  if ( currentTexture ) then -- if he had clothes of that type
    local tempA, tempB = getTypeIndexFromClothes ( currentTexture, currentModel ) -- get the type and index for these clothes, so we can decrease and get the previous in the list
    if ( tempA and tempB ) then -- if we found them
      clothesType, clothesIndex = tempA, tempB
    end
  end
  clothesIndex = clothesIndex - 1
