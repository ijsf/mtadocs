{{Server client function}}
Closes a file handle obtained by [[/fileCreate.md|fileCreate]] or [[/fileOpen.md|fileOpen]].

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool fileClose ( file theFile )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[/file.md|file]]:close}}
{{OOP||[[/file.md|file]]:destroy}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''theFile:''' The file handle to close.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if successful, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example creates a text file and writes a string to it.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local newFile = fileCreate("test.txt")                -- attempt to create a new file
if newFile then                                       -- check if the creation succeeded
    fileWrite(newFile, "This is a test file!")        -- write a text line
    fileClose(newFile)                                -- close the file once you're done with it
end
</syntaxhighlight>

It is important to remember to close a file after you've finished all your operations on it, especially if you've been writing to the file. If you don't close a file and your resource crashes, all changes to the file may be lost.
