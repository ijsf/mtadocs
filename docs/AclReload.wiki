 
{{Server function}} 
<!-- Describe in plain english what this function does. Don't go into details, just give an overview -->
This function reloads the ACL's and the ACL groups from the ACL XML file. All ACL and ACL group elements are invalid after a call to this and should not be used anymore.

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool aclReload ()
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP|This function is a static function underneath the ACL class.|[[/ACL.md|ACL]].reload||}}
===Returns===
<!-- Make this descriptive. Explain what cases will return false. If you're unsure, add a tag to it so we can check -->
Returns ''true'' if the XML was successfully reloaded from the file, ''false'' or ''nil'' if the XML was invalid, didn't exist or could not be loaded for some other reason.

==Example== 
<!-- Explain what the example is in a single sentance -->
This example allows an admin to reload the ACL by typing "/reloadACL".
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function reloadACL ( source, command )
-- Check if they're an admin...
	if ( isObjectInACLGroup ( "user." .. getAccountName ( getPlayerAccount ( source )), aclGetGroup ( "Admin" ) ) ) then
		local reload = aclReload() -- Reload the ACL
			if ( reload ) then -- Check it was reloaded successfully
				outputChatBox ( "ACL was successfully reloaded.", source, 255, 0, 0 ) -- If so, output it
			else -- If not, output it (line below)
				outputChatBox ( "An unknown error occured. Please check the ACL file exists.", source, 255, 0, 0 )
			end
	else -- If they're not an admin, output it (below)
		outputChatBox ( "You must be an admin to use this command!", source, 255, 0, 0 )
	end
