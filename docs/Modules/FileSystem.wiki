Its feature-set covers '''binary stream writing''', '''directory scanning''' and '''path resolution logic'''. It should satisfy all needs regarding file functionality. The modules' source code is released within the MTA:Eir SVN.

Its documentation can be found [[/MTA:Eir/FileSystem.md|here]]. To find coding examples, ''browse the individual class methods''.
