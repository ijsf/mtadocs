{{ml_birc}}

This function returns the first {{ml_birc|ircbot}} pointer of the bot with the specified name. It's useful if you don't have access to the variable where bot was originally stored in {{ml_birc|ircCreateBot}}.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
ircbot ircGetBotByName ( string botName )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''botName:''' The name of the ircbot you want to get.

===Returns===
Returns the {{ml_birc|ircbot}} pointer if ircbot with specified name was found, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
This example adds a command ''getbotstate'' which can be used to check the current state of an ircbot.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function getIrcBotState ( thePlayer, commandName, botName )
    local theBot = ircGetBotByName ( botName )
    if theBot then
        outputChatBox ( botName .. " is currently " .. ircGetBotState ( theBot ) .. "." )
    else
        outputChatBox ( "There's no ircbot called " .. botName .. "!" )
    end
end
addCommandHandler ( "getbotstate", getIrcBotState )
</syntaxhighlight>
