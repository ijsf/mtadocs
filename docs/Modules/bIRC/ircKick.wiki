{{ml_birc}}

This function can be used to kick user from the specified channel. The specified {{ml_birc|ircbot}} often needs to have suitable privileges in order for this to work.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool ircKick ( ircbot theBot, string channel, string user, [ string reason = "" ] )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theBot:''' The ircbot which is going to do the kicking
*'''channel:''' The channel where user should be kicked from
*'''user:''' The user who should be kicked

===Optional Arguments===
{{OptionalArg}}
*'''reason:''' The reason for the kick

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if passed arguments were valid, ''false'' otherwise.<br>
'''Note:''' Does not return ''true'' if the user was successfully kicked or ''false'' if it failed. You can check if the user was kicked by using callback {{ml_birc|event_ircOnKick}}.

==Example==
This example creates an ircbot called ''DummyBot'', makes it connect to a server and join a channel. It also includes an IRC command '!kick' which can be used to kick users from the channel.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function resourceStart ( )
    theBot = ircCreateBot ( "DummyBot" )
    ircConnect ( theBot, "irc.gtanet.com", 6667 )
end
addEventHandler ( "onResourceStart", getResourceRootElement ( getThisResource() ), resourceStart )
 
function event_ircOnConnect ( theBot )
    setTimer ( ircJoinChannel, 2000, 1, theBot, "#testchannel" )
end
 
function event_ircOnText ( theBot, channel, sender, message )
    if message:find( "!kick" ) then
        local params = split ( message, string.byte (' ') )
        -- params[1] has the string "!kick" which we don't need
        -- params[2] has the user name
        if ircIsInChannel ( theBot, channel, params[2] ) then
            ircKick ( theBot, channel, params[2] )
        end
    end
end
