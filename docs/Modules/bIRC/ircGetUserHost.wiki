function event_ircOnConnect ( theBot )
    setTimer ( ircJoinChannel, 2000, 1, theBot, "#testchannel" )
end

function event_ircOnText ( theBot, channel, sender, message )
    if message:find( "!ban" ) then

                local hostMask = ircFormatHost ( params[2] .. "!" .. userHost )
                if hostMask then -- and if formatting was successful
                    ircSetChannelMode ( theBot, channel, "+b " .. hostMask )
