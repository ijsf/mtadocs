The ircbots are the main “elements” of the Basic IRC module. They are used in almost every function the module provides and they do the echoing between IRC and MTA server. There are various functions and callbacks to manipulate their actions. This way the server controller will have a full control over the IRC echoing system.

The ircbots can be created with function and can be destroyed using function .
