function event_ircOnConnect ( theBot )
    setTimer ( ircJoinChannel, 2000, 1, theBot, "#testchannel" )
end

function event_ircOnText ( theBot, channel, sender, message )
    if message:find( "!limitusers" ) then
        local params = split ( message, string.byte (' ') )
        -- params[1] has the string "!limitusers" which we don't need
        -- params[2] has the user count
        if tonumber( params[2] ) then -- check if it's a number, but don't convert it to a number
            ircSetChannelMode ( theBot, channel, "+l " .. params[2] )
        elseif params[2] == "off" then -- if user passes 'off' as the number, remove the limit
            ircSetChannelMode ( theBot, channel, "-l" )
        end
