{{ml_birc}}

This function is used to change the name of the specified {{ml_birc|ircbot}}.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool ircSetName ( ircbot theBot, string name )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theBot:''' The ircbot which name you want to change
*'''name:''' The new name of the ircbot

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' passed arguments were valid, ''false'' otherwise.<br>
'''Note:''' Does not return ''true'' if ircbot's name was successfully changed or ''false'' if the bot's name wasn't changed. You can check if the bot had it's name changed by using callback {{ml_birc|event_ircOnNickChange}}.

==Example==
This example creates an ircbot called ''DummyBot'' and makes it connect to a server and join a channel once it has connected. It also includes an IRC command '!setname <name>' which can be used to change ircbot's name.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function resourceStart ()
    dummyBot = ircCreateBot ( "DummyBot" )
    ircConnect ( dummyBot, "irc.gtanet.com", 6667 )
end
addEventHandler ( "onResourceStart", getResourceRootElement ( getThisResource() ), resourceStart )

function event_ircOnConnect ( theBot )
    setTimer ( ircJoinChannel, 2000, 1, theBot, "#testchannel" )
end

function event_ircOnText ( theBot, channel, sender, message )
    if message:find( "!setname" ) then
        local params = split ( message, string.byte (' ') )
        -- params[1] has the string "!setname" which we don't need
        -- params[2] has the new name
        ircSetName ( theBot, params[2] )
    end
end
