{{MTA0.5 page}}
Portland was introduced into MTA in version 0.4. In this version, it was the only GTA3 map supported. The other maps, [[/GTA3_Staunton.md|Staunton Island]] and [[/GTA3_SSV.md|Shoreside Vale]], were added in version 0.5.

Portland's gameplay is pretty basic. You spawn as Claude, armed with only a baseball bat and a pistol. Everyone plays as the same character. Other weapons are dotted around the map or are available for purchase from various Ammunation stores around the map.
