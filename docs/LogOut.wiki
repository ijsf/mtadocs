</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP|Also available as a static class function [[/Account.md|Account]].logPlayerOut|[[/player.md|player]]:logOut||}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePlayer:''' The player to log out of his current account

This example logs every player out of their account when the resource is (re)started. This would be handy for resources that show a login screen onClientResourceStart.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function logoutAll ()
	local players = getElementsByType ( "player" ) -- Get every player
		for k, player in ipairs ( players ) do -- For every player do the following...
			account = getPlayerAccount ( player ) -- Get every player's account
				if ( not isGuestAccount ( account ) ) then -- For every player that's logged in....
					logOut ( player ) -- Log them out.
				end
		end
end
 -- Trigger it when the resource (re)starts
addEventHandler ( "onResourceStart", getResourceRootElement(), logoutAll )</syntaxhighlight>
