Nil is a type with a single value, ''nil'', whose main property is to be different from any other value. A global variable has a ''nil'' value by default, before a first assignment, and you can assign ''nil'' to a global variable to delete it. Lua uses ''nil'' as a kind of non-value, to represent the absence of a useful value.
