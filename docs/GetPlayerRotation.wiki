{{Server client function}}
{{Deprecated|getElementRotation|}}

This function returns the current rotation (in degrees) of a player around the Z axis. It's used with on-foot players: use [[/getVehicleRotation.md|getVehicleRotation]] on the occupied [[/vehicle.md|vehicle]] if the player is in one.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
float getPlayerRotation ( player thePlayer )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''thePlayer''': the [[/player.md|player]] whose rotation you want to retrieve.

===Returns===
Returns a ''float'' containing the player's rotation, or ''false'' if an invalid player (or one in a vehicle) was passed.

==Example==
This code adds a ''getrot'' command to get the player's current rotation.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function outputPlayerRotation ( sourcePlayer )
	-- if the command was triggered by an ingame player
	if ( sourcePlayer ) then
		-- if he is in a vehicle
		if isPlayerInVehicle ( sourcePlayer ) then
			-- store the vehicle element
			local playerVehicle = getPlayerOccupiedVehicle ( sourcePlayer )
			-- and output its rotation
			local x,y,z = getVehicleRotation ( playerVehicle )
			outputChatBox ( "Your vehicle's rotation is: " .. z, sourcePlayer )
		-- if he is on foot
		else
			-- output the player's rotation
			outputChatBox ( "Your rotation is: " .. getPlayerRotation ( sourcePlayer ), sourcePlayer )
		end
	end
end

-- register outputPlayerRotation as a handler for the getrot command
addCommandHandler ( "getrot", outputPlayerRotation )
</syntaxhighlight>
