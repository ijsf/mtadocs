===Notes===
This document outlines the network protocol for the Remote Administration system used in Multi Theft Auto : San Andreas Race Modification R1. This document is intended for people to create their own Remote Administration tools if they wish to.

No details will be given on how creation of these tools can be done, please seak outside assistance if help is required in this
area. This document is only meant as a guide.

===Warning===
THE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM IN MTA:SA HAS A SCHEDULED OVERHALL PLANNED FOR FUTURE RELEASES. AS A RESULT THE NETCODE IN THIS DOCUMENT WILL BE CHANGING SIGNIFICANTLY. NOTIFICATION OF THIS WILL BE GIVEN WHEN A VERSION IS RELEASED WITH ANY CHANGES.

Strings sent in the bytestream will be denoted like:
 [ string ( description ) ]

Variable bytes sent will be denoted like:
 [ byte ( description ) ]

Looped information in packets will be denoted like:
