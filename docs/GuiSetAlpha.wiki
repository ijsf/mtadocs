{{Client function}}

This changes the alpha level (the visibleness/transparency) of a GUI element

==Syntax== 
<!-- NOTE: don't use 'special' names for variable names, e.g. you shouldn't be writing things like 'player player, vehicle vehicle', instead write something like 'player thePlayer, vehicle vehicleToGetInto'. This is less confusing and prevents the syntax highlighting being odd -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool guiSetAlpha ( element guielement, float alpha )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''guiElement:''' the GUI element whose visibility is to be changed
*'''alpha:''' The visibility/transparency of the GUI element. Ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). Default value is 0.80.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the gui element's alpha was successfully changed, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This creates a GUI window and allows a player to change it's alpha (the visibleness/transparency) value with a command.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">--Create a gridlist
myWindow = guiCreateWindow ( 0.30, 0.10, 0.5, 0.60, "GUI window title", true )

--Add a command handler to change the alpha of the GUI window.
--Usage example: '/alpha 0.8', where 0.8 is stored as alphaAmount
function changeAlpha ( commandName, alphaAmount )
		alphaAmount = tonumber(alphaAmount)
		guiSetAlpha ( myWindow, alphaAmount )
end
addCommandHandler ( "alpha", changeAlpha )
</syntaxhighlight>
