{{Server function}}
 
This checks if an element is visible to a player. This does not check if the player can literally see the element, just that they are aware that it exists. Some so-called [[/per-player elements.md|per-player elements]] are able to be visible only to some players, as such this checks if this is the case for a particular element/player combination.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool isElementVisibleTo ( element theElement, element visibleTo )          
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[/element.md|element]]:isVisibleTo||}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theElement:''' The element you want to check the visibility of
*'''visibleTo:''' The player you want to check against

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if element is visible to the specified player, ''false'' if not or an invalid argument was passed to the function.

==Example== 
This checks if the player is visible to them selves.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">addEventHandler("onPlayerSpawn",root,function()
     if not isElementVisibleTo(source,source) then --if the player is not visible to them selves
          setElementVisibleTo(source,source,true) --then make them visible to them selves.
     end
end)
</syntaxhighlight>
