== Development ==
=== API ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- trainNode is a Vector3, or table of three coordinates
-- nodes is a table of trainNodes

track = TrainTrack(...nodes) -- createTrack(node1, node2, node3, ...)
track:getNodes() returns a table of Vector3s
track:getLength() -- getTrainTrack(track)
-- Default track functions
TrainTrack.removeDefault(int trackID)
TrainTrack.resetDefault(int trackID)

-- These functions already exist, but I'm not sure how these lengths are used or what they are for

</syntaxhighlight>

=== Findings ===
All information related custom train tracks are stored here.

==== m_OriginalTrainTrackData ====
The [https://pastebin.mtasa.com/748483851 m_OriginalTrainTrackData array] contains the same values in CTrainTrackManager.cpp and CTrainTrackManagerSA.cpp.

The Init function is structured like so (pay special attention to the comments):
<code>
typedef struct
{
    short sX;               // x coordinate times 8
    short sY;               // y coordinate times 8
    short sZ;               // z coordinate times 8
    float fRailDistance;    // on-rail distance ( leave the client to calculate this )
    void Init ( short sX, short sY, short sZ, unsigned short sRailDistance, WORD padding )
    {
        this->sX = sX;
        this->sY = sY;
        this->sZ = sZ;
        this->fRailDistance = sRailDistance;
    }
} SRailNode;
</syntaxhighlight>

We need to make sense of the following things:

* Why is padding an argument here? (It doesn't do anything, and when Init() is called, real values are provided)
* Why are values repeated several times? 
* Why does the last repeat have slightly different values?

=== Issues ===
* There may be some issues (relating to infinite loops) if a track runs across another or crosses another
** Infinite loop occurs at 006f8fda, see [http://i.imgur.com/HvBWAFm.png call stack]. Occurs when a track of two nodes have same x/y, but different z. Only occurs for tracks that ONLY consist of nodes atop each other.
*** Possible solution: when creation tracks, ensure that atleast one of the nodes has a different x/y to any other node.
* Tracks may not be cleaned up -> See CTrainTrackManager::ResetTracks
* See CTrainTrackManager and CTrainTrackManagerSA - why is this file so big? Why are coordinates provided multiple times for the same track? Which ones are right?
* <strike>int CWorldSA::FindClosestRailTrackNode needs updating. It needs to use MAX_TOTAL_TRACKS and the train manager.</strike> [https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue/commit/09e3ee8f25810c17742728f038786b6a223c5296 See 09e3ee8f25810c17742]
