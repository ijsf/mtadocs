{{Client function}}

{{New items|3.0140|1.4|
This function downloads a file from the HTTP server. This can only be used on files on the HTTP server associated with the MTA server and will only download files from within the folder of the resource that is calling it. The '''file''' should also be included in meta.xml with the '''download''' attribute set to "false", see [[/meta.xml.md|meta.xml]] for more details. If the file has been previously downloaded and the CRC matches, the file will not be downloaded again but [[/onClientFileDownloadComplete.md|onClientFileDownloadComplete]] will still run.
}}
{{Tip|If you are only using [[/downloadFile.md|downloadFile]] to download mod files after other resources, then do not use [[/downloadFile.md|downloadFile]], and instead set<br/> '<download_priority_group>-1</download_priority_group>' in the resource [[/meta.xml.md|meta.xml]]}}
{{Note|This function may cause performance issues with client and/or server.}}
