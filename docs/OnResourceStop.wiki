{{Server event}}
This event is triggered when the resource is stopped. This can occur for a number of reasons:
* The ''stop'' console command was used
* The ''restart'' console command was used
* The resource was modified (the resource will automatically restart)
* Another resource stopped it using [[/stopResource.md|stopResource]].

'''Note:''' If you wish to just detect a single resource being stopped, you should attach handlers for this event to the resource's root element. You can access this using [[/getResourceRootElement.md|getResourceRootElement]]. 

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
resource stoppedResource
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''stoppedResource''': The resource that is being stopped.

<!-- Add the event's source in the section below -->
==Source==
The [[/event_system#Event_source.md|source]] of this event is the root [[/element.md|element]] of the resource that is being stopped.

==Example==
This example displays a message in the chatbox when a resource is stopped.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler ( "onResourceStop", root, 
    function ( resource )
        outputChatBox ( "The Resource " .. getResourceName(resource) .. " was stopped!", root, 255, 255, 255 )
   end 
)
</syntaxhighlight>
