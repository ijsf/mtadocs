{{Server function}}
{{Note|You can also compare if a version is higher than another using the ''<'' or ''>'' operators.}}

This function gets the client version of the specified [[/player.md|player]] as a sortable string. The string is always 15 characters long and is formatted as follows:

* 1 character representing the major version
* 1 dot character
* 1 character representing the minor version
* 1 dot character
* 1 character representing the maintenance version
* 1 dash character
* 1 character representing the build type
* 1 dot character
* 5 characters representing the build number
* 1 dot character
* 1 character representing the build revision

An example of a version string would be: 1.0.4-9.01746.0

Where the first three numbers represent the major/minor/maintenance version, i.e. 1.0.4<br>
The fourth number is 9, which means it's a release build, (Development and beta builds have lower numbers here)<br>
And the fifth and sixth numbers represent the build number.
