Introduction
------------

The Shoreside Vale island is a new addition to GTA3:MTA, added in version 0.5. Shoreside Vale has two things different from the other GTA3:MTA islands: the character selection screen, and jumping height is increased. When you jump, you go farther and higher than you normally would. This was implemented to dodge car-killers.

Weapons
-------

You can also choose from a range of different weapons before spawning.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
![GTA3\_Uzi.png](/images/gta3_uzi.png)

</td>
<td>
An Uzi is selected by default in the character selction menu. This is a good all-around weapon.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
![GTA3\_Flame.png](/images/gta3_flame.png)

</td>
<td>
The Flamethrower is a popular choice, although flamethrowing players are often unpopular with other players. This is more suited to close-range combat. Some will even ban people who use the flamethrower to kill.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
![GTA3\_AK47.png](/images/gta3_ak47.png)

</td>
<td>
The AK-47 is suitable for long-range combat.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
![GTA3\_Shotgun.png](/images/gta3_shotgun.png)

</td>
<td>
The most common choice is the Shotgun. Shotgun duels are frequent, and take advantage of “shotgun jumping.” This is when you shoot the opponent, jump over to the opponent, then shoot him while he's on the ground. This normally results in an instant kill.
